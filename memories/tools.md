# Local tools & CLIs

## gh (GitHub CLI)
- `gh` opens a pager (alternate buffer) that hangs the agent terminal.
- Always disable it: pipe `| cat` or set `GH_PAGER=cat` (e.g. `gh pr view 116 | cat`).

## Re-triggering the @claude PR *review* (d-morrison Quarto / R-pkg repos, e.g. `psw`)
- Filenames below are those in the **content/package repos** (verified in
  `d-morrison/psw`): the review workflow is `.github/workflows/claude-code-review.yml`
  and the comment-triggered agent workflow is `.github/workflows/claude.yml`.
  (ai-config's *own* bot uses different names — `claude-review.yml` /
  `claude-bot.yml` — so don't infer these from *this* repo's `.github/workflows/`.)
- The review workflow (which calls `d-morrison/gha`'s reusable review workflow)
  is **not** comment-triggered. It runs on `pull_request` (`types: [opened,
  synchronize, ready_for_review, reopened]`) and on `workflow_dispatch` (input
  `pr_number`). Posting an `@claude review` *comment* drives the separate agent
  workflow `claude.yml` (which then re-dispatches a review after it pushes) — it
  does not directly fire the review workflow.
- A new push (`synchronize`) auto-fires a fresh review — the normal path during
  an iterate loop.
- To force a fresh review on an existing PR **without a new commit**:
  - **workflow_dispatch** (preferred — no extra PR timeline noise). Same
    dispatch, three ways to send it:
    - **`gh`:** `gh workflow run claude-code-review.yml -f pr_number=<N>`
      (dispatches the workflow as defined on the **default branch** — `gh`
      defaults `--ref` to it).
    - **REST** (remote/web sessions, no `gh`):
      `POST /repos/<owner>/<repo>/actions/workflows/claude-code-review.yml/dispatches`
      with body `{"ref":"main","inputs":{"pr_number":"<N>"}}` (`"main"` = the
      repo's **default branch**; the `ref` must be a branch/tag that *contains*
      the workflow file, not the PR branch, unless you mean to dispatch a
      modified version).
    - **GitHub MCP:** your workflow-dispatch tool if available (e.g.
      `mcp__github__actions_run_trigger`).
  - **Close + reopen the PR** → fires the `reopened` event, which re-runs the
    review. Works reliably, but clutters the timeline with close/reopen events;
    prefer workflow_dispatch unless dispatch isn't available.

## GitHub MCP tools (Claude Code remote/web sessions)
- In remote/web sessions the authenticated GitHub identity is the repo owner
  (`d-morrison`), so requesting `d-morrison` as a PR reviewer fails with
  `422 Review cannot be requested from pull request author`. Harmless — the PR
  is still created; the reviewer just isn't added. Don't treat the 422 as a
  failure to retry (it's expected per the standing request-pr-review rule when
  the author == the requested reviewer).
- `gh` is NOT available in these sessions — use the `mcp__github__*` tools for
  all GitHub interactions (PRs, issues, comments, reviews). CI status is always
  available via `mcp__github__pull_request_read` (`get_check_runs` / `get_status`)
  and the `mcp__github__actions_*` tools. Some environments may *also* expose a
  separate `github_ci` MCP server (`mcp__github_ci__*`, e.g. `get_ci_status`),
  which can connect asynchronously after session start. Don't conclude a tool is
  absent from one check — `ToolSearch` for what you need before deciding it's
  missing (and don't assume the `github_ci` server is present either).
- `mcp__github__pull_request_read` `method:` enum: `get` · `get_diff` (PR
  unified diff — equivalent to `gh pr diff`) · `get_status` · `get_files` ·
  `get_commits` · `get_review_comments` · `get_reviews` · `get_comments` ·
  `get_check_runs`.
- Webhook PR-activity events cover comments/reviews/CI *failures* but NOT CI
  *success*, new pushes, or merge-conflict transitions — don't rely on events
  alone to know a PR went green or merged; re-check explicitly.

## Git tags (force-move / slide)
- To move a tag to a new commit: `git tag -d <tag> && git tag <tag> <target> && git push origin :refs/tags/<tag> && git push origin <tag>`
- Can't use `git push --force origin <tag>` on some GitLab instances (protected tags). The delete+recreate pattern always works.
- `git fetch --tags` silently refuses to update a local tag that already exists if the remote moved it. Use `git fetch --tags --force` to get the latest remote tag positions. Without `--force`, you'll see stale local tags and draw wrong conclusions about what the tag includes.

## Git branch create/reset (`git switch -C`)
- `git switch -C "$BRANCH"` is already safe against flag-shaped branch names: `$BRANCH` is the argument *to* `-C`, so a value like `--weird` fails cleanly as `fatal: '--weird' is not a valid branch name` rather than being parsed as an option.
- Do NOT "harden" it to `git switch -C -- "$BRANCH"` — that form is **broken**: the `--` is consumed as the branch name (the required argument to `-C`), so `$BRANCH` is parsed as the start-point instead and the command fails without creating the branch. (Verified on git 2.x; a review bot suggested the broken form on d-morrison/gha#58.)

## GitLab Discussions API (inline diff comments)
- Endpoint: `POST /projects/:id/merge_requests/:iid/discussions`
- For inline comments, include `position` object: `position_type: "text"`, `base_sha`, `head_sha`, `start_sha`, `new_path`, `old_path`, `new_line`
- Get SHAs from MR Versions API: `GET /projects/:id/merge_requests/:iid/versions` → `[0].base_commit_sha`, `[0].head_commit_sha`, `[0].start_commit_sha`
- If the position is rejected (e.g., line not in diff), the API returns 400 — handle gracefully

## glab (GitLab CLI)
- Installed via Homebrew (macOS) or system package manager — verify with `which glab`.
- Authenticated on your GitLab instance — run `glab auth status` to verify host and username
- Use for MR comments, pipeline checks, CI job logs, etc.
- `glab issue list --opened` is deprecated — `--opened` is the default when `--closed` is not used. Just use `glab issue list` (no flag needed).
- No `GITLAB_TOKEN` env var — glab uses its own config at `~/Library/Application Support/glab-cli/config.yml`
- Key commands:
  - `glab ci list` — list pipelines
  - `glab ci get --pipeline-id <ID>` — view pipeline details (non-interactive)
  - `glab ci create --branch <branch>` — trigger a NEW pipeline (picks up upstream template changes)
  - `glab ci retry --branch <branch>` — retries the EXISTING pipeline (does NOT pick up template changes)
  - `glab ci view <id>` — requires TTY; use `glab ci get` or `glab api .../trace` instead
  - `glab api "/projects/<ID>/jobs/<JOB_ID>/trace"` — get job log non-interactively
  - `glab mr note create <MR_IID> --message "..."` — post MR comment
  - `glab mr list` — list merge requests
  - `glab mr view <MR_IID>` — view MR details
- GitLab CI job token allowlist:
  - When repo A's CI job needs API access to repo B, repo B must add A to its allowlist
  - `glab api --method POST "/projects/<TARGET_ID>/job_token_scope/allowlist" -f "target_project_id=<SOURCE_ID>"`
  - `include:` (for CI templates) works independently of the API allowlist
  - Check existing: `glab api "/projects/<ID>/job_token_scope/allowlist"`

## Julia in Claude Code cloud / web sessions
- To install Julia, prefer downloading the official binary tarball from
  `julialang-s3.julialang.org` via `curl` (system CA store) over `juliaup`:
  juliaup's rustls HTTP client rejects TLS-intercepting proxies common in cloud
  environments, so it can fail even when the host is allowlisted. Prebuilt Linux
  Julia binaries live ONLY on `julialang-s3.julialang.org` — the
  `JuliaLang/julia` GitHub releases attach source tarballs only. `Pkg`
  operations need `pkg.julialang.org` allowlisted too.
- Reference implementation: `references/cloud-setup/cloud-setup.sh` in ai-config
  (curl+tarball, `$SUDO`-aware, best-effort/non-fatal).
- Layering: the build-time **Setup script** is the right place for slow,
  repo-independent toolchain installs (R, Julia, Quarto); the **SessionStart
  hook** is for repo-dependent per-session work (`renv::restore`,
  `Pkg.instantiate`). BUT the build-time Setup script can't be committed to a
  repo (it's pasted into the web UI), so a SessionStart hook is the only
  in-repo lever to auto-install a toolchain for *that repo's own* sessions.

## @claude CI action (d-morrison/gha `claude.yml`)
- The reusable `claude.yml@v1` agent workflow restores config files (`CLAUDE.md`,
  `.claude/**`) to `origin/main` during its run (`restoreConfigFromBase`), so a
  PR can't rewrite the reviewer's own instructions. With `eager-pr: true` +
  `contents: write`, the **residual auto-commit step** historically then committed
  that reset onto the PR branch as `claude[bot]` "chore: auto-commit residual
  @claude session changes" — **deleting the PR's own `CLAUDE.md` edits**.
  `memories/**` and `skills/**` were untouched; only the restored-config paths
  were affected.
- **FIXED in gha `v1` (≈2026-06-20):** the residual sweep now force-reverts the
  protected config paths (incl. `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude`, `.mcp.json`, `.gitmodules`,
  `.husky`) back to **PR-tip (HEAD)** before `git add -A`, so it no longer commits
  the reset. A follow-up commit (`78fe7bc`, "honor PR deletions of config files in
  the residual sweep") prevents the sweep from reverting legitimate config-file
  deletions in the PR.
  Verified on ai-config#41: once the fix landed, the gut stopped recurring (the
  config-edit payload stayed on the branch across later bot runs). Was tracked as
  d-morrison/gha#39.
- If a repo pins an **older** gha tag (pre-fix), the workaround still applies. The
  symptom was `claude[bot]` "auto-commit residual @claude session changes" commits
  that reverted only config paths. Restore the section
  (`git checkout <my-commit> -- CLAUDE.md`, commit), then before merging verify with
  `git diff origin/main -- CLAUDE.md` being **non-empty** (an empty diff means the
  payload was silently reverted to main), and merge promptly.

## AskUserQuestion (Claude Code harness tool)
- Each entry in `questions[]` **requires a `question` field** (the full question
  text) — `header` + `options` alone fail with `InputValidationError: required
  parameter questions[0].question is missing`. Easy to omit when you build the
  call from options first; include the `question` string every time.

## Bash tool runs under zsh — avoid bash-isms & reserved variable names
- The Bash tool's shell is zsh-initialized, where some names are **read-only
  special variables**: `status`, `path`, `pipestatus`, `argv`, `options`, `?`.
  Assigning to them (e.g. `status=$(...)` in a poll loop) fails with
  `read-only variable: status` and aborts the command.
- Use neutral names instead — `st`, `rc`, `out`, `p`. Bit a `gh run view`
  status-poll loop once; renaming `status`→`st` fixed it.
- **No bash-only builtins.** `mapfile`/`readarray` are undefined in zsh —
  `mapfile -t arr < <(cmd)` fails with `command not found: mapfile`. Iterate the
  glob/list directly instead, e.g. `for d in skills/*/; do s=$(basename "$d");
  …; done`, rather than slurping into an array first. This matters double for
  **skill command blocks**: the user's local shell is zsh too, so a command
  block I write into a skill gets run under zsh — keep it bash/zsh-portable.
  (A `mapfile` loop in the link-skills draft failed this way; PR #71.)

## Skill command blocks — resolve the ai-config repo root with the per-skill symlink
- To `cd` to the repo root from inside a skill, use the **per-skill** form
  `git -C ~/.claude/skills/<this-skill> rev-parse --show-toplevel`, never the
  bare-parent `git -C ~/.claude/skills rev-parse --show-toplevel`. `bootstrap.sh`
  may symlink skills
  *per-child* into a real `~/.claude/skills` directory, so the parent isn't a
  symlink into the repo and `git -C` there fails with "not a git repository".
  The `@claude` reviewer enforces the per-skill form on new skills (it flagged
  the bare-parent form on PR #71); `skill-builder` and `ums` already use it.
- Open issue #36 proposes standardizing on `git -C ~/.claude/skills rev-parse
  --show-toplevel` (the bare-parent) — its example is the unreliable one (it can
  error with "not a git repository", not a security risk); prefer the per-skill
  form until #36 is reconciled.
- **Worktree caveat:** the resolved toplevel is the **MAIN** checkout, often on
  another session's branch — don't author files there. Work in your own
  worktree's `skills/<name>/` dir (full rationale in `skill-builder`'s Ship-it
  caveat).
