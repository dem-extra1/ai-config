# Setup script for Claude Code (claude.ai/code) cloud sessions.
#
# Paste the CONTENTS of this file into the environment's "Setup script" field
# (claude.ai web UI -> the environment for this repo). Do NOT point the field at
# `bash scripts/cloud-setup.sh`: the Setup script runs at environment-build time,
# before/independently of the repo checkout, so a repo path is not on disk yet
# and fails with "No such file or directory" (exit 127). This file is the
# version-controlled source of truth -- keep the web-UI copy in sync with it (and
# with .github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml). The script is self-contained:
# it touches no repo files, so it works whether or not the repo is present.
#
# The default Claude Code template adds the `deadsnakes` and
# `ondrej/php` PPAs, which this R/Quarto project does not need and which broke
# apt (launchpad 403 / "no longer signed", plus a broken `add-apt-repository`).
# This script installs only what the project actually uses, with NO third-party
# apt repositories.
#
# Scope: system libraries + R + Julia + Quarto/TinyTeX + the `renv` package. It
# does NOT run the full `renv::restore()` or the `inst/julia` Pkg.instantiate() --
# those are heavy and are launched in the background by the SessionStart hook
# (scripts/restore_renv.sh) once the session is up and the repo is on disk.
# Together the two cover the whole toolchain.
#
# Source of truth for these steps: .github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml
# (the GitHub Actions setup, verified in CI). Keep the two in sync when
# dependencies change.
#
# These commands target the Ubuntu (noble) base image used by Claude Code cloud
# sessions. The apt package list is copied verbatim from the CI workflow above.
# R is installed from CRAN's apt repo and Quarto from its .deb -- the plain-shell
# equivalents of the `r-lib/actions` and `quarto-actions` steps, both using the
# system CA store so they work behind a TLS-intercepting proxy. If a future base
# image or upstream installer changes, re-check the URL flagged "VERIFY" below.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Revisions in this reference copy (vs. the original reviewed script). Each is
# marked inline with `# [review]`. They are behavior-preserving robustness
# fixes -- no dependency or host changed:
#   1. Root/sudo aware: run privileged steps via $SUDO, which is empty when
#      already root (the cloud Setup script often is) and "sudo" otherwise.
#      Avoids exit-127 aborts on images where root has no `sudo` binary.
#   2. Quarto install is now truly best-effort: the `apt-get install` of the
#      .deb is folded into the success condition, so a failure there warns and
#      continues (as the comments always intended) instead of aborting under
#      `set -e`.
#   3. Idempotent renv install: skipped when renv is already present, so
#      resume/rebuild runs don't reinstall it.
#   4. Idempotent TinyTeX: an already-installed TinyTeX skips the slow,
#      rate-limit-prone reinstall but still re-pins the CTAN mirror.
#   5. JULIA_MINOR is resolved before it is echoed, so the banner reports the
#      version actually used.
#   6. The resolved Quarto version is sanity-checked against a `N.N` pattern
#      before building the download URL, so a changed redirect format fails
#      fast into the warning instead of fetching a garbage URL.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
