# wait-for-results

Block on one or more long-running jobs until they finish, then run the
follow-up step the work needs (combine, build, deploy, report). Because the
wait may outlive the session, this skill **leads with a handoff** so state is
never lost.

## When this fires

- "wait for results", "wait for the jobs", "poll until done then <do X>".
- Right after launching a long job (SLURM array, CI run, background task,
  remote agent) that you intend to act on at completion.

## Step 1 — Hand off first (always)

Invoke the `handoff` skill **immediately**, before waiting. This snapshots the
branch/HEAD/unpushed commits/job IDs/pick-up steps into a project memory and
posts a paused-state note on any active PR/MR. The point: if the session ends
or context resets while you're waiting, the next session resumes cleanly with
zero lost state.

Refresh the handoff (re-run it) if the situation materially changes during the
wait — a job fails, the plan changes, or new commits land.

## Step 2 — Identify what to wait on and the success condition

Pin down, concretely:
- **What** the jobs are — SLURM array IDs, background task IDs + output files,
  CI run, etc.
- The **done** condition — `squeue` empty, expected output-file count reached,
  `gh run watch` exits, a sentinel file appears.
- The **follow-up step** to run on success (e.g. `combine-slurm-results.R`), and
  what counts as failure (missing chunks, non-zero exit, error in logs).

## Step 3 — Poll on a sensible cadence

Pick the waiting mechanism by whether the wait must survive the session ending
or a context reset:

- **`ScheduleWakeup` (primary for cross-session survival).** Schedule a
  re-invocation with a cadence matched to the job and a long fallback
  heartbeat. This is the only mechanism that wakes the model back up *after*
  the current session has ended, so prefer it whenever the wait may outlive the
  session.
- **Background Bash loop (same-session short waits).** Run the poll as a
  background Bash command so the session stays responsive; the harness
  re-invokes you when the command exits — but only while *this* session is
  still alive. If the session has already ended, a finished loop wakes nobody,
  so don't rely on it to survive a reset.

Either way, match the cadence to how fast the state actually changes; don't
burn cycles polling every few seconds for a multi-hour job.

```bash
# Same-session example: wait for a SLURM array, then verify chunk count
for i in $(seq 1 240); do
  sleep 60
  if [ -z "$(squeue -u "$USER" --name=<job-name> 2>/dev/null | tail -n +2)" ]; then
    echo "JOBS DONE (check $i); outputs: $(ls <output-glob> 2>/dev/null | wc -l)"
    break
  fi
done
# Fallback: the loop has a silent 4-hour ceiling (240 × 60s). If it exhausted
# without breaking, the jobs are still running — make that observable.
if [ "$i" -eq 240 ] && [ -n "$(squeue -u "$USER" --name=<job-name> 2>/dev/null | tail -n +2)" ]; then
  echo "TIMEOUT: jobs still running after 240 checks — run a fresh handoff and check manually."
fi
```

## Step 4 — On completion, verify then run the follow-up

- **Verify** the success condition before acting — e.g. expected output count,
  no failures in `logs/`, clean exit. If the jobs failed or came up short,
  **stop and report** rather than running the follow-up on bad inputs.
- **Run the follow-up step**, capture its output, and sanity-check the result.
- **Update the handoff memory** to reflect the new state (jobs done, results
  produced, next action), and update or close the PR paused-note accordingly.
- Recap to the user with a local-time stamp: what finished, what the follow-up
  produced, and what's next.

## Relationship to other skills

- `handoff` — run first (Step 1) and refreshed at the end; this skill *includes*
  it so the wait is crash-safe.
- `memories/preferences.md` (the "always leave handoff notes proactively"
  bullet) — the policy that makes Step 1 mandatory.
- `claim-pr` — the paused note posted via `handoff` lives inside an existing
  claim.
