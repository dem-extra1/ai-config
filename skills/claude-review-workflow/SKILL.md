description: Add or modify the `anthropics/claude-code-action` PR review workflow (`.github/workflows/claude-code-review.yml`). Preserves the load-bearing patterns — fresh-comment-per-run (no sticky delete), inline-comment encouragement, the event-gated track_progress, and the workflow_dispatch path claude.yml uses to re-dispatch reviews.

# claude-review-workflow

Sets up or edits the Claude PR **review** workflow (`claude-code-review.yml`),
which runs the upstream `code-review@claude-code-plugins` plugin on a PR. For
the **agent** workflow that edits files in response to `@claude` mentions, use
[[claude-agent-workflow]].

Path: `.github/workflows/claude-code-review.yml`

## Load-bearing pieces (don't "simplify" away)

### 1. Fresh comment per run — do NOT delete prior reviews

Each run posts a **new** review comment and leaves earlier ones in place, so
the PR keeps a visible review history rather than a rolling sticky.

**Do not add a "delete previous Claude sticky comment" pre-step.** An older
version of this skill recommended exactly that; it was wrong and is rejected —
deleting prior reviews erases history and the delete-then-repost churns
notifications. (If you find such a step in a repo, remove it.) The canonical
workflows (qwt, rme) explicitly leave priors in place.

### 2. Encourage inline comments

The action already makes inline review comments possible — `permissions:
pull-requests: write`, and the inline tool available either by allowlisting
`mcp__github_inline_comment__create_inline_comment` (qwt) or via the default
toolset when you only use `--disallowedTools` (rme). But the
`code-review:code-review` plugin **defaults to a single top-level summary**
with prose line-references, so you have to *push* it toward real inline
comments in the prompt:

```
**Post line-specific findings as inline review comments** anchored to the
relevant line(s) — use the inline-comment tool, not a prose list in the
summary. Reserve the top-level summary comment for a brief overall verdict
plus any finding not tied to a specific line; don't restate each inline
comment there.
```

Caveat: the plugin drives much of the behavior, so prompt-strengthening only
*partly* moves it — verify on a live PR and iterate the wording. (Added in
qwt#93 / rme#833.)

### 3. Event-gated `track_progress`

```yaml
track_progress: ${{ github.event_name == 'pull_request' && 'true' || 'false' }}
```

`track_progress: true` forces tag mode, which guarantees a tracking comment
even when the plugin scores the PR below its post threshold (≥80). **But the
action rejects `track_progress` for `workflow_dispatch`** and fails the whole
step — and `claude.yml` dispatches this workflow via `workflow_dispatch`. So
gate it on `event_name`: tag mode for `pull_request`, agent mode for dispatched
runs (which may then be silent on small/mechanical PRs — acceptable vs. the
dispatch path failing outright). See d-morrison/rme#818, #801.

### 4. `workflow_dispatch` path with `pr_number` input

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      pr_number: { description: 'Pull request number to review', required: true, type: number }
```

`claude.yml` dispatches a fresh review after an `@claude` run pushes commits
or on an `@claude review` comment. `GITHUB_TOKEN`-driven pushes don't fire
`synchronize`, so this explicit dispatch path is required, and the job must
resolve `PR_NUMBER` from `github.event.pull_request.number || inputs.pr_number`.

### 5. Skip drafts / Dependabot / forks — except dispatched runs

The `if:` runs `workflow_dispatch` unconditionally (so a review fires on the
draft PR claude.yml opens for an issue trigger), otherwise skips drafts,
`dependabot[bot]`, and fork PRs (forks can't read `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`,
so the run would fail with a noisy red check).

### 6. Concurrency

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: claude-review-${{ github.event.pull_request.number || inputs.pr_number }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

`cancel-in-progress: true` is safe here **only because this workflow is
read-only** (its tools grant no git push/commit, so it never pushes a fix and
can't self-cancel). A review workflow that can push fixes must guard against
cancelling its own triggered run — see d-morrison/rme#817.

## Setting up in a new repo

1. Confirm `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` secret exists (`gh secret list`).
2. Write the workflow with the pieces above. Keep the read-only tool posture
   (`--disallowedTools` for git writes, or an allowlist without them).
3. Add a repo-specific addendum to the prompt (Quarto/R checks, etc.) if the
   project warrants it — see qwt's review workflow for an example.
