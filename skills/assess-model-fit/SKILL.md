# assess-model-fit — Evaluate current model capability

Determine whether the current Claude model is sufficient for your task, or recommend
escalation to a higher-level model. Runs in **procedural mode** (checklist guidance)
or **executable mode** (analyze a task and auto-recommend).

## Procedure

### Assess model fit (manual, procedural mode)

1. **Identify the current model.** Check your Claude Code session or settings.json.
   Common models: Fable 5 (`claude-fable-5`), Haiku 4.5 (`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`),
   Sonnet 4.6 (`claude-sonnet-4-6`), Opus 4.8 (`claude-opus-4-8`).

2. **Score your task against these criteria.** A task needs escalation (higher model)
   if it hits any of these red flags:
   - **Deep multi-step reasoning:** more than 5 logical steps, complex dependencies, or
     architectural design decisions
   - **Code review rigor:** assessing code for subtle bugs, security gaps, performance,
     or architectural issues (not just syntax)
   - **Large context window needed:** task involves many files, long documents, or
     substantial history to reason over
   - **Complex decomposition:** breaking down an ambiguous problem into sub-tasks and
     choosing the right approach (not following a clear spec)
   - **Uncertain scope:** task requirements are vague and need clarification by reasoning
   - **Novel problem:** no standard solution applies; requires creative or exploratory thinking

3. **Make a go/no-go decision:**
   - **Current model is adequate** if:
     - Task is straightforward, well-specified, and mostly single-purpose
     - Reasoning is shallow (1–3 steps) and the path is clear
     - Code generation or simple Q&A, not deep review or design
     - Context is small (single file, short query)
   - **Escalate to higher model** if you checked yes on any red flag above

4. **If escalation needed,** invoke `/select-model` to determine the target.

   Describe your task, and `select-model` will recommend Sonnet or Opus and suggest
   a config update if you want it.

### Executable mode (auto-analysis and auto-chaining)

Instead of running the checklist manually, invoke the skill with a task description.
The script will analyze the task, output an assessment, and if escalation is needed,
automatically call `select-model`:

```
/assess-model-fit --task "I need to refactor a large REST API module and add comprehensive unit tests"
```

The script reads your current model, evaluates the task complexity, and either gives
you a go-ahead or chains into `select-model` with your task details.

## How to use

- **Procedural mode (manual checklist):** Read this procedure, run through the
  scoring criteria, decide if escalation is needed.
- **Executable mode (auto-analysis):** Invoke `/assess-model-fit --task "<your task description>"`
  and let the script recommend a verdict and model.
- **When in doubt:** Use executable mode — it's faster and catches nuance the
  manual checklist might miss.
