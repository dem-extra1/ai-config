# defer-issue

When the user decides to push something out of the current scope, file a
new issue in the appropriate forge that captures the deferred work cleanly
enough for them (or a future Claude) to pick it up cold.

## When this fires

User says something like:

- "let's defer this"
- "defer this for later"
- "create a followup issue for X"
- "we'll handle that in a separate PR"
- "make this its own issue"

Don't fire just because something looks unfinished. The user must
explicitly defer.

## Procedure

### 1. Identify the forge

```sh
git remote get-url origin
```

| Host                     | CLI                     |
|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| `github.com`             | `gh issue create`       |
| `gitlab.com` / self-hosted GitLab | `glab issue create` |
| Bitbucket / Gitea / other | ask the user how to file |

If the matching CLI isn't installed, surface that and stop — don't try to
file via the raw HTTP API without confirming.

### 2. Gather context

From the current conversation, identify:

- **What is being deferred** (one sentence — becomes the title)
- **Concrete work needed** (what change, which files, what "done" looks like)
- **Why deferring** (out of scope, needs design discussion, blocked on X)
- **Where the deferral was raised** (PR number, commit SHA, file:line, review thread)

If any of these are unclear from context, ask the user briefly before
filing. A vague follow-up issue is worse than no issue.

### 2b. Search for an existing issue first — including CLOSED ones

Before filing, check the tracker so you don't create a duplicate. Search
**both open and closed** issues by keyword — deferred review findings are
often pre-filed by an earlier session or the review bot and may already be
**closed** (e.g. as a duplicate, or decided), which an open-only search
misses:

```sh
gh issue list --state all --search "<keywords>" --json number,title,state
# GitLab: glab issue list --all -S "<keywords>"
```

- If an **open** issue already covers it, link that one instead of filing —
  report its URL and stop.
- If a **closed** issue covers it, surface it to the user (it may have been
  closed as a duplicate pointing elsewhere, or closed as decided) and confirm
  whether to reopen it, file fresh, or treat the matter as settled — don't
  blindly file a second one.

This is the **never assume; always verify** rule applied to issue filing: a
quick search beats leaving two issues tracking the same work.

### 3. Compose the issue

**Title:** short, imperative, specific. Good: `Refactor session_env merge
logic to handle nested overrides`. Bad: `Followup`, `TODO from PR #42`.

**Body template:**

```markdown
## Context

Deferred from <source: e.g., PR #42, commit abc1234, review on path/to/file.R:120>.

<1–2 sentences on why this work is being split off from the current change>

## What to do

<concrete description: what change, which files, what success looks like>

## Why not now

<reason for deferring — out of scope, needs design, blocked, etc.>
```

### 4. Create the issue

**GitHub:**

```sh
gh issue create \
  --title "..." \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
...
EOF
)"
```

- Defaults to the current repo (whatever `gh` resolves from remotes /
  `gh repo set-default`).
- If filing into a different repo than the current one, pass
  `--repo <owner>/<repo>` and confirm with the user first.
- Check `gh label list` for an existing `followup`, `deferred`, or
  `tech-debt` label and add it with `--label`. **Don't fabricate labels
  that don't exist** — `gh` will fail and you'll have to retry.
- Don't add `🤖 Generated with Claude Code` attribution to the issue body
  unless the user asks. Issue attribution isn't covered by the global
  `attribution` setting.

**GitLab:**

```sh
glab issue create --title "..." --description "$(cat <<'EOF'
...
EOF
)"
```

### 5. Report back and offer the cross-link

Print the new issue's number and URL as a **bare URL** (so it's clickable
in the user's terminal — markdown links render as label-only and lose the
URL). Example:

```
Filed followup: https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/123
```

If the deferral originated in an open PR or issue, **offer** to add a
`Followup: #<new-issue>` reference to that source thread — don't do it
unprompted. The user may want different wording or may not want a
cross-reference at all.

## Edge cases

- **Not in a git repo / no remote:** stop and tell the user. Don't try to
  invent a target repo.
- **Forked PR (head repo != base repo):** file the issue in the **base**
  repo by default — that's where the work will actually land — and
  confirm if it's ambiguous.
- **Different tracker entirely** (Linear, Jira, repo-specific issue
  tracker): ask the user where to file. Don't assume GitHub/GitLab just
  because the source is hosted there.
