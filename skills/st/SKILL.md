# st — Start Task (issue-first)

Kick off a new piece of work **issue-first**: never jump straight into a PR.
Every new task gets a tracking issue before any branch or edit. This is the
complement to `gi` — `gi` grabs an issue that already exists; `st` is for work
you have in mind that isn't tracked yet, so you write the issue first and then
flow into the same implement → PR → ARDI tail.

## When this fires

- "st", "start a task", "start a new task", "new task", "let's work on X"
  where X has no open issue yet.
- Any time you're about to start coding something that isn't already covered
  by an open tracking issue.

## Core rule: issue before PR

Before branching or editing, ensure an issue exists:

1. **Search** the tracker for an existing issue covering the task.
2. **Exists** → use it — this is just `gi` on that number.
3. **None** → **file one first**, then proceed.

Why issue-first: the issue is the durable record of intent, scope, and "done"
criteria. It gives reviewers context, lets the PR auto-close it via
`Closes #N`, prevents duplicate/undiscoverable work, and means there's a
tracked home for the task even if the PR stalls.

## Procedure

### 1. Restate the task and "done" criteria

One or two sentences: what's the change, why, and what "done" looks like. If
you can't state "done", the issue isn't ready to write yet — clarify scope
first.

### 2. Search for an existing issue

```bash
# GitHub — open first, then all states (it may already be filed or closed)
gh issue list --state open --search "<keywords>" --json number,title,url | cat
gh issue list --state all  --search "<keywords>" --limit 10 \
  --json number,title,state,url | cat

# GitLab
glab issue list --search "<keywords>" --per-page=20 2>&1 | cat
```

- **Open match** → an issue already exists, so this is just `gi` on that
  number: invoke the `gi` skill from its claim step onward (claim → check
  history → branch → implement → PR → ARDI). Skip the rest of `st` — you don't
  need to file anything.
- **Closed match** → surface it ("looks like #N already covered this and was
  closed") and confirm with the user before re-doing the work.

### 3. File the issue (if none exists)

```bash
# GitHub
gh issue create --title "<concise title>" --body "<what & why>

**Done when:** <acceptance criteria>
<scope notes / out-of-scope>"

# GitLab
glab issue create --title "<concise title>" --description "<what & why>

**Done when:** <acceptance criteria>"
```

- Keep scope tight — **one concern per issue** (see `split-concerns`). If the
  task is really several concerns, file several issues.
- Capture acceptance criteria so "done" is unambiguous later.
- Label it if the repo uses labels.
- Then **claim it** (`claim-pr` pattern) so a parallel session / the `@claude`
  bot doesn't collide:
  ```bash
  gh issue comment <N> --body "Claude Code CLI (local session) is working on this — paws off until I'm done."
  ```

### 4. Check history

Invoke `check-history` before implementing — review merged/closed MRs that
touched the same area so you don't undo past progress.

### 5. Branch → implement → PR → ARDI

From here the tail is identical to `gi`:

```bash
git fetch origin main
git checkout -b <type>/<slug> origin/main   # fix/ feat/ docs/ refactor/
```

- Implement (code, tests, docs), run the repo's standard checks, commit
  referencing the issue (`fix: … (closes #N)`).
- Push and open the PR with `Closes #N` in the body, then request `d-morrison`
  as reviewer (`request-pr-review`):
  ```bash
  git push -u origin <type>/<slug>
  gh pr create --title "<title>" --body "Closes #<N>

  <what was done and why>"
  ```
- **ARDI** the PR to a clean verdict (`ardi`). Don't merge unless asked.

### 6. Report

Linked issue + PR, ARDI round count, and any deferred follow-up issues.

## Relationship to other skills

- **`gi`** — once the issue exists, the implement → PR → ARDI tail is the same;
  `st` is "`gi`, but you write the issue first."
- **`defer-issue`** — same issue-creation mechanics, for sub-tasks that emerge.
- **`check-history`**, **`claim-pr`**, **`request-pr-review`**, **`ardi`**,
  **`split-concerns`** — invoked along the way.
- **`post-merge`** — closes the lifecycle that `st` opens, once the PR lands.

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Opening a PR with no tracking issue behind it.
- ❌ Filing a duplicate without searching open **and** closed issues first.
- ❌ A vague issue with no "done" criteria.
- ❌ Re-doing already-closed work without flagging it to the user.
- ❌ Cramming multiple independent concerns into one issue/PR.
