  Audit the current codebase (or a specified scope) for opportunities to
  simplify, DRY, outsource to well-maintained external tools/packages, reduce
  maintenance burden, and improve clarity. Produces a prioritized list of
  concrete refactoring suggestions. Use when asked to "tidy", "simplify",
  "clean up", "DRY this out", or "what can we outsource/remove". Invoke
  explicitly with /tidy.

# tidy

Audit the codebase for opportunities to reduce complexity, duplication, and
maintenance burden. Produce a **prioritized, actionable** list of suggestions
— not vague advice.

## When this fires

- User says `/tidy`, "tidy up", "simplify", "DRY this", "what can we remove",
  "what can we outsource", or similar.
- After a large feature lands and the user wants a cleanup pass.
- When reviewing a repo for the first time and looking for quick wins.

## Scope

If the user specifies a file, directory, or topic, restrict the audit to that
scope. Otherwise, audit the full workspace.

## What to look for

Evaluate the codebase along these axes (in priority order):

### 1. Dead code & unused features
- Functions/modules/files never called or imported.
- Feature flags that are always on/off.
- Commented-out code blocks.

### 2. Outsource to external tools
- Hand-rolled logic that a well-maintained package/CLI already handles
  (e.g., custom YAML parsing → use a library; hand-rolled HTTP retry →
  use a retry library; custom linting rules → existing linter plugin).
- Vendored code that could be a dependency instead.
- Shell scripts reimplementing `jq`, `yq`, `sed` pipelines that a
  purpose-built tool does better.

### 3. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Duplicated logic across files that could be extracted into a shared
  helper/module.
- Copy-pasted config blocks that could be templated or parameterized.
- Repeated patterns that suggest a missing abstraction.

### 4. Simplify
- Over-engineered abstractions (more indirection than the problem warrants).
- Deeply nested conditionals that could be flattened with early returns or
  guard clauses.
- Complex shell pipelines that could be a single tool invocation.
- Overly defensive code for impossible states.

### 5. Reduce maintenance burden
- Pinned dependency versions that could use ranges.
- CI/CD steps that could be consolidated or parallelized.
- Documentation that duplicates what the code already says.
- Config files with stale/irrelevant entries.

## Output format

Present findings as a numbered list, grouped by axis, with:

1. **What**: One-line description of the issue.
2. **Where**: File(s) and line(s) affected.
3. **Suggestion**: Concrete action to take (not "consider refactoring" —
   say exactly what to extract, replace, or delete).
4. **Impact**: Low / Medium / High — how much maintenance burden it removes.
5. **Effort**: Low / Medium / High — how much work the fix is.

Sort within each group by impact÷effort (best bang-for-buck first).

## What NOT to do

- Don't make the changes yourself unless explicitly asked. This is an audit.
- Don't suggest changes that alter public API or behavior without flagging
  the breaking-change risk.
- Don't suggest "rewrite in language X" — stay within the current stack.
- Don't flag style/formatting issues — that's the linter's job.
- Don't suggest adding complexity (new abstractions, frameworks) unless
  it clearly nets out simpler.

## After the audit

Ask the user which items (if any) they'd like you to implement. Offer to:
- Implement the top-N items in this session.
- File issues for deferred items.
- Skip items the user disagrees with.
