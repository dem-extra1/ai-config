  Repair a skill that just misfired — fired when it shouldn't have, failed to
  fire when it should have, or led the session astray. Diagnose the root cause
  from where the session got confused, propose a minimal fix to the skill's
  trigger/description/body, and apply it with the user's approval. Use when the
  user says "that skill confused you", "heal that skill", "fix the skill that
  misfired", "that shouldn't have triggered", or right after a skill visibly
  went wrong. Invoke explicitly with /heal-skill.

# heal-skill

Close the feedback loop on skill quality: when a skill misbehaves in a real
session, repair it *now*, while the failure is in front of you. This is the
retrospective complement to *authoring* a skill and to `ums` (which records
learnings) — it fixes a skill that already shipped and then misfired.

## When this fires

- A skill triggered on the wrong input, or failed to trigger on the right one.
- A skill fired correctly but its body led the work astray (bad steps, stale
  instructions, wrong assumptions).
- The user says "that skill confused you", "heal that skill", "the description
  is too greedy", "that shouldn't have fired", or `/heal-skill`.

## Procedure

### 1. Identify the culprit

Determine which skill misfired. If it's not named, infer it from what just
happened — the slash command invoked, the description that matched, or the
behavior that went wrong. Confirm the skill name with the user if ambiguous.
Read its `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` in full before changing anything.

### 2. Diagnose the root cause

Classify the failure — the fix differs by type:

- **False trigger** (fired when it shouldn't): the `description` is too broad,
  or its trigger phrases overlap a more general request. Fix: tighten the
  description, narrow the trigger phrases, add an explicit "don't fire when…"
  note.
- **Missed trigger** (didn't fire when it should): the `description` lacks the
  user's phrasing. Fix: add the missing trigger phrases / synonyms.
- **Ambiguous overlap** (two skills compete for the same request): fix the
  boundary in *both* descriptions so each owns its lane; cross-link them.
- **Bad body** (fired right, acted wrong): a step is wrong, stale, or
  underspecified. Fix the offending step; verify any file/flag/command it names
  still exists.

State the diagnosis in one or two sentences before proposing the fix.

### 3. Propose a minimal fix

Draft the smallest change that addresses the root cause — usually a few lines
of the frontmatter `description` or one body step. Show the user the exact diff
and the reasoning. Don't rewrite the whole skill; don't add unrelated polish.

### 4. Apply with approval, then validate

On approval, edit the SKILL.md. Then sanity-check it still parses and is
internally consistent: run `scripts/validate-skills.py` if the repo has it, and
re-read the trigger against the failure that prompted the heal. If this repo
ships skills via branch + PR, follow that flow rather than committing to main.

### 5. Record the lesson

If the misfire reflects a pattern worth remembering (a recurring over-trigger,
a phrasing the user favors), hand off to `ums` to persist it, so the next skill
is authored without the same flaw.

## Relationship to other skills

- **`skill-builder`** — the authoring counterpart; it writes a skill, this skill
  repairs one after it ships and misfires.
- **`link-skills`** — the proactive, whole-corpus cross-link audit; `heal-skill`
  is the single-skill reactive repair, and fixing an ambiguous overlap here
  means cross-linking the two skills (exactly what `link-skills` sweeps for).
- **`consolidate-skills`** — when two skills have real bodies for the same
  workflow, that's a merge, not a heal; hand it there.
- **`ums` / `record-learnings`** — hand off to persist a recurring misfire as a
  remembered lesson, so the next skill is authored without the same flaw.

## What NOT to do

- Don't delete or disable a skill to "fix" a single misfire — repair the
  trigger or body instead. If a skill is genuinely redundant with another (two
  real bodies for one workflow), that's a merge, not a heal — hand it to
  `consolidate-skills`.
- Don't broaden a description so far that it starts stealing other skills'
  triggers; healing a missed-trigger shouldn't create a false-trigger.
- Don't make unrelated edits in the same pass — keep the heal minimal and
  reviewable.
- Don't change behavior the user was happy with; only touch what misfired.
