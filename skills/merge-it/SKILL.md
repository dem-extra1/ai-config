# merge-it — merge a ready PR, then wrap up automatically

The active counterpart to `post-merge`. When I say "merge it", I mean: do the
merge now (the PR is ready), then run the whole post-merge wrap-up
(verify → tidy → UMS) **on your own, without asking**. Asking "want me to run
UMS?" after merging is the exact gap this skill closes — the answer is a
standing yes (see `preferences.md`).

## When this fires

- "merge it", "merge this", "merge the PR", "go ahead and merge" (as an
  explicit merge directive). Deliberately excludes vague approval like "ship
  it" / "lgtm" — merging is irreversible, so require an explicit merge verb.
- Distinct from `merge-main` / `sync-pr-branch` (those merge `main` *into* a
  branch to sync it — they do NOT merge the PR).
- If the PR is **already merged**, skip steps 2–3 and go straight to step 4
  (`post-merge`).

## Procedure

### 1. Identify the PR and confirm it's ready — never assume

- Resolve which PR is meant (the one from the current session; if ambiguous,
  ask which number).
- Confirm it is **fully clean** before merging (the ARDI terminal state — see
  `shared/workflow/fully-clean.md`): all required CI checks green AND the latest
  review clean.
  Verify with a fresh query, not a cached verdict:
  `mcp__github__pull_request_read` (`get` for `mergeable_state`, `get_check_runs`
  for CI) — or `gh pr view <N>` / `gh pr checks <N>` in a local session.
- If CI is red or the review still has open findings, **do not merge** — report
  what's blocking instead. (Only merge a not-clean PR if the user explicitly
  says to anyway.)

### 2. Merge

- Default to **squash** for a feature branch with many small iteration commits
  (and/or a merge-of-main commit) — it gives `main` one clean commit. Use a
  plain merge commit only if the user asks or the repo clearly prefers it; don't
  stop to ask for a method on a routine feature PR.
- Give the squash an accurate **commit title and body** when the PR body has
  gone stale across the review loop — pass `commit_title` / `commit_message`
  rather than letting GitHub paste the outdated description. Keep `Closes #N` in
  the message so the linked issue auto-closes.

```bash
# remote/web (GitHub MCP):
#   mcp__github__merge_pull_request  merge_method=squash  commit_title=…  commit_message=…
# local:
gh pr merge <N> --squash --subject "<title>" --body "<accurate summary; Closes #N>"
```

In remote/web sessions, load the merge tool's schema with `ToolSearch`
(`select:mcp__github__merge_pull_request`) before the first call to confirm the
exact name and parameters — the `d-morrison/gha` CLAUDE.md mapping table
(`tools.md`) is the canonical `gh`→MCP reference.

### 3. Verify the merge landed — never assume

Confirm `merged == true` (the merge tool's result) and re-check the PR state and
that the linked issue auto-closed. If the merge didn't land (conflict, branch
protection, not mergeable), **stop and report** — don't tidy or run UMS.

### 4. Chain into `post-merge` — automatically

Run the `post-merge` skill (invoke it by name) for the rest: tidy the local
branch (checkout `main`, pull, `git branch -d`, remove any worktree), confirm
deferred items are tracked, and **run UMS** to bank what the PR's review
lifecycle taught. Do this without a separate prompt — opening the UMS follow-up
branch + PR is a standing yes (`preferences.md`).

## Relationship to other skills

- **`post-merge`** — step 4 delegates to it. `post-merge` assumes the PR is
  already merged (verify → tidy → UMS); `merge-it` adds the actual merge in
  front of it for the "it's clean, merge it" case.
- **`merge-main` / `sync-pr-branch`** — merge `main` INTO a PR branch to sync;
  unrelated to merging the PR itself. Don't confuse the trigger words.
- **`ardi` / `iterate`** — the loop that gets a PR to fully-clean; `merge-it`
  is what you run once it's there and the user says go.
- **`ums`** — the learnings step `post-merge` runs at the end.
- **`wrap-up` / `merged`** — session-level bookend; `merge-it` is per-PR.

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Asking "want me to run UMS / wrap up?" after merging — it's automatic.
- ❌ Merging a PR that isn't fully clean (red CI or open findings) without the
  user explicitly saying so.
- ❌ Letting the squash commit inherit a stale PR description — pass an accurate
  title/body when the body no longer matches the final diff.
- ❌ Confusing "merge it" (merge the PR) with "merge main" (sync the branch).
- ❌ `git branch -D` (force) in the tidy without checking why `-d` refused.
