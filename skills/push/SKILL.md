# push

A guard you run **right before `git push`**. Other sessions, reviewers, and the
`@claude` CI bot can all be working the same branch. Pushing blind risks
clobbering their work or shoving commits onto a branch someone explicitly held.
This skill runs a short pre-push check, and if anything looks off it **stops and
asks you** rather than pushing.

## When this fires

- The user says "push", "push this", "push my changes", or `/push`.
- Any time you're about to push commits to a **shared** branch (one with an open
  PR, or one another session may be driving).

It does **not** need to fire for a brand-new branch that has never been pushed
and has no PR — there's nothing to collide with. Still run the protected-branch
check in that case.

## Pre-push checks

Run these in order. Stop at the first one that fires and ask the user (see
[Asking for guidance](#asking-for-guidance)).

### 1. Protected branch

```bash
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
```

If the current branch is `main` (or `master` / the repo's default branch),
**do not push.** Pushing to the default branch is almost never intended — surface
it and ask whether to branch first.

### 2. Remote HEAD advanced past your last commit

Another session or the author may have pushed since your last fetch.

```bash
BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
git fetch origin "$BRANCH" 2>/dev/null
# Commits on the remote that you don't have locally:
git log --oneline HEAD.."origin/$BRANCH" 2>/dev/null
```

If `origin/$BRANCH` has commits you didn't push, **back off** — another session
(or the author) is driving this branch right now. Do not push (a plain push will
be rejected anyway, and you must not force-push over their work). Ask the user.

### 3. "Paws off" claim by someone else

Look at the open PR for this branch for a claim comment posted by **another**
session or person. (Your own most-recent "I'm working on this" comment is fine —
that's your claim.)

```bash
PR=$(gh pr view --json number,headRefName -q .number 2>/dev/null)
gh pr view "$PR" --json comments \
  -q '.comments[] | select(.body | test("paws off"; "i")) | "\(.author.login): \(.body)"'
```

If the latest "paws off" comment is from someone **other than you** and hasn't
been unclaimed, **do not push.** Ask the user.

### 4. Hold / block labels

```bash
gh pr view "$PR" --json labels -q '.labels[].name'
```

If any label signals a hold — case-insensitive matches on `do-not-merge`,
`do not merge`, `WIP`, `hold`, `blocked`, `on hold`, `dont-merge` — **do not
push.** Ask the user.

### 5. `@claude` agent run in flight

Don't push while the bot is mid-session on the branch — your push can collide
with its commits or trigger a redundant re-run.

```bash
gh run list --branch "$BRANCH" --json status,name \
  -q '.[] | select(.status=="in_progress" or .status=="queued") | .name'
```

If a `@claude` / review workflow is `in_progress` or `queued`, wait for it to
finish, then re-check. If it's stuck, ask the user.

## Asking for guidance

When a check fires, **do not push.** Use `AskUserQuestion` to surface exactly
what fired and let the user decide. Give concrete options, e.g.:

- **Wait / re-check** — back off and re-run the checks shortly (HEAD-advanced or
  `@claude`-in-flight cases).
- **Push anyway** — the user knows the signal is stale (e.g. their own old hold
  label, a resolved claim).
- **Branch first** — for the protected-branch case, create a feature branch and
  push that instead.
- **Skip the push** — leave the commits local for now.

Include the specifics in the question (which label, whose claim, how many
commits ahead) so the user can answer without digging.

## Pushing (checks clean)

Once every check passes, push with the standard upstream + retry backoff:

```bash
git push -u origin "$BRANCH"
```

If the push fails on a **network** error, retry up to 4 times with exponential
backoff (2s, 4s, 8s, 16s). Do **not** retry — and do **not** force-push — if it
fails because the remote rejected a non-fast-forward (that's check #2 surfacing
late: fetch, reconcile, re-run the checks).

After a successful push, if the branch has no PR yet, open one (ready for
review, not a draft).

## Relationship to other skills

- **`claim-pr`** — posts/removes the "paws off" claim comment this skill reads
  in check #3. `push` is the read side; `claim-pr` is the write side.
- **`session-lock` / `deconflict-sessions`** — the local-checkout counterpart:
  it keeps parallel sessions on one machine from sharing a working tree. `push`
  guards the *remote* branch; `session-lock` guards the *local* tree.
- **`sync-pr-branch` / `merge-main`** — when check #2 fires because `main` (not
  the branch) moved ahead, sync the branch first, then push. `sync-pr-branch`
  ends in a push and should itself honor these checks.
- **`ardi`** — its push step should run these checks; the "detect an active
  parallel session before pushing" note in `claim-pr` is the same guard.

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Force-pushing over commits another session added (check #2)
- ❌ Pushing past a fresh "paws off" claim from someone else (check #3)
- ❌ Pushing onto a `do-not-merge` / `hold` PR without asking (check #4)
- ❌ Pushing while a `@claude` run is mid-session on the branch (check #5)
- ❌ Pushing directly to `main` / the default branch (check #1)
- ❌ Reporting "pushed" when a check stopped you — say what fired and that you're
  waiting on the user
