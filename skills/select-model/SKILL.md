# select-model — Choose the right Claude model

Determine which Claude model (Fable 5, Haiku 4.5, Sonnet 4.6, or Opus 4.8) is
best for your task. Runs in **procedural mode** (decision tree reference) or
**executable mode** (analyze a task and recommend a model with optional config update).

## Procedure

### Model tiers at a glance

**Fable 5** (`claude-fable-5`)
- Fastest, lowest cost
- Minimal reasoning, narrow focus
- Best for: Trivial tasks, high-volume throughput, cost optimization
- Not recommended for: Complex reasoning, multi-step planning, code review

**Haiku 4.5** (`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`)
- Speed + focused reasoning
- Handles simple queries and straightforward code tasks
- Best for: Simple Q&A, basic code generation, narrow-scope work
- Limitations: Shallow reasoning (1–2 steps), limited code review depth

**Sonnet 4.6** (`claude-sonnet-4-6`)
- Balanced: good reasoning + acceptable speed
- Handles multi-step tasks and moderate code review
- Best for: Multi-step problem solving, code review (medium rigor), refactoring, multi-file tasks
- Limitations: Not ideal for deep architectural design or subtle security analysis

**Opus 4.8** (`claude-opus-4-8`)
- Deepest reasoning, most thorough analysis
- Excels at design, complex decomposition, sophisticated code review
- Best for: Complex architecture, multi-file refactors with design decisions, R&D, subtle bugs
- Trade-off: Slower, higher cost (justified for hard problems)

### Decision tree: Pick your model

1. **Is the task trivial?** (single query, no reasoning)
   - YES → **Fable 5** (save cost)
   - NO → Continue

2. **Does the task fit in a narrow scope?** (single file, simple logic, <5 steps)
   - YES → **Haiku 4.5** (fast, focused)
   - NO → Continue

3. **Does the task involve multi-step reasoning or moderate complexity?**
   (refactoring, multi-file changes, moderate code review)
   - YES → **Sonnet 4.6** (balanced tier)
   - NO → Continue

4. **Does the task require deep reasoning, sophisticated design, or rigorous review?**
   (architecture, complex refactor, subtle bugs, security analysis)
   - YES → **Opus 4.8** (most capable)

### Task → Model mapping

| Task Category | Complexity | Recommended | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| Simple query | ⭐ | Fable or Haiku | Minimal reasoning; speed matters |
| Code snippet gen | ⭐ | Haiku | Straightforward; Haiku is fast enough |
| Bug fix (obvious) | ⭐ | Haiku | Clear problem, known fix pattern |
| Refactor (small scope) | ⭐⭐ | Haiku or Sonnet | If single file + clear pattern → Haiku; else → Sonnet |
| Multi-file refactor | ⭐⭐ | Sonnet | Needs coordination across files; Sonnet handles this well |
| Moderate code review | ⭐⭐ | Sonnet | Checks logic, style, obvious bugs |
| Complex refactor | ⭐⭐⭐ | Sonnet or Opus | If risky or touches architecture → Opus |
| Architecture design | ⭐⭐⭐ | Opus | Needs deep reasoning; Opus's strength |
| Subtle bug hunt | ⭐⭐⭐ | Opus | Requires deep analysis, lateral thinking |
| Security review | ⭐⭐⭐ | Opus | Risk of missing subtle vulns with lower models |
| Research/exploration | ⭐⭐⭐ | Opus | Ambiguous scope; Opus excels at decomposition |

### Model selection factors

- **Context window:** All models have large windows, but Opus handles complex multi-file reasoning best
- **Reasoning depth:** Fable < Haiku < Sonnet < Opus (in that order)
- **Code generation:** Haiku and Sonnet both strong; Opus overkill for boilerplate
- **Code review:** Haiku weak at subtle issues; Sonnet good; Opus best
- **Multi-step planning:** Haiku struggles; Sonnet solid; Opus excellent
- **Speed:** Fable > Haiku > Sonnet > Opus (tradeoff with capability)
- **Cost:** Fable < Haiku < Sonnet < Opus

### Executable mode (auto-recommend and config update)

Instead of consulting the decision tree manually, invoke the skill with a task
description. The script will analyze complexity, check your current settings,
recommend the right model, and optionally suggest a config update:

```
/select-model --task "I need to refactor a critical payment module with security implications"
```

The script outputs a recommendation and optionally suggests updating `.claude/settings.json`
to use the recommended model for this session.

## How to use

- **Procedural mode (manual decision tree):** Read this procedure, follow the
  decision tree or task mapping, choose your model.
- **Executable mode (auto-recommend):** Invoke `/select-model --task "<task description>"`
  and the script provides a personalized recommendation and config suggestion.
- **Chained from assess-model-fit:** If `/assess-model-fit` recommends escalation,
  it auto-invokes `select-model` with your task details.

## FAQ

**Q: I'm using Haiku but it keeps failing. What now?**
A: Escalate to Sonnet or Opus. Use this skill to confirm the better tier for your task.

**Q: Opus is expensive. Can I use Sonnet instead?**
A: Yes, if your task doesn't need deep reasoning. Use the decision tree above to verify.
If unsure, try Sonnet first; if it struggles, escalate to Opus mid-session.

**Q: Should I always use the highest model?**
A: No—higher models are slower and costlier. Match the model to task complexity.
Use Haiku for simple work, Sonnet for medium, Opus for hard problems.

**Q: Can I pick a model manually without using this skill?**
A: Yes. This skill is advisory. You can always override and choose your own model.
