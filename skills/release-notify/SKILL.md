# Release-Notify — Tag + Notify Revdeps of Breaking Changes

After merging a breaking change to a shared template/library repo, tag the
release and file migration issues on every affected consumer repo.

## Procedure

1. **Determine the version bump.** Breaking changes get a major version bump
   (v1 → v2, v2 → v3). If the repo uses semver with minor/patch, bump the
   major. Check existing tags with `git tag -l | sort -V`.

2. **Create an annotated tag** on the merged main:
   ```bash
   git checkout main && git pull origin main
   git tag -a vN -m "vN: <short description> (breaking change)

   <migration instructions>"
   git push origin vN
   ```

3. **Identify affected consumer repos.** Use multiple strategies (don't rely
   on any single one):
   - Check `REVDEPS.md` if the repo has one (advisory — not authoritative).
   - Search the group/org for repos referencing the old behavior:
     ```bash
     # GitLab: check each project's CI config for the old pattern
     for pid in <project_ids>; do
       result=$(glab api "projects/$pid/repository/files/.gitlab-ci.yml/raw?ref=main" 2>&1)
       if echo "$result" | grep -q "<old_pattern>"; then
         echo "MATCH: $pid"
       fi
     done
     ```
   - For GitHub: use `gh search code` or the code search API.

4. **File a migration issue on each affected repo.** Include:
   - What changed and why
   - The exact migration steps (ideally a diff)
   - What breaks if they don't update
   - A link to the MR/PR and the new tag
   - Assign to the maintainer and label appropriately

5. **Update REVDEPS.md** if any new consumers were discovered during the
   search (that weren't already listed).

6. **Report a summary** with clickable links:

   | Consumer | Issue filed |
   |----------|-------------|
   | [repo-a](url) | [#N](url) |
   | [repo-b](url) | [#M](url) |

## Key principles

- **REVDEPS.md is advisory.** It speeds up discovery but is never the sole
  source of truth. Always verify with a search.
- **Don't skip notification** even for repos you think are inactive — let
  the maintainer decide.
- **One issue per consumer** — don't batch notifications into a single issue
  on the template repo.
- **Include migration steps in the issue body** — don't make the consumer
  go hunting for what to change.

## When to use

- After merging any breaking change to a shared template/library repo
- When bumping a major version
- When asked to "release", "tag", "notify consumers", or "notify revdeps"
