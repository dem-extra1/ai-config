# merged (alias for `wrap-up`)

This is a **synonym for [`wrap-up`](../wrap-up/SKILL.md)** — the two are
interchangeable. There is no separate behavior here.

**Do this:** read `~/.claude/skills/wrap-up/SKILL.md` and follow its
instructions exactly. Everything that skill says — verify the real state of
every PR/issue/branch/working tree, report a linked final summary that surfaces
anything still open, then run a UMS review to persist what was learned —
applies unchanged.

Keep the logic only in `wrap-up`; this file is just the `/merged` entry point
so the two names stay in sync.

> `/merged` routes to [`wrap-up`](../wrap-up/SKILL.md), not
> [`post-merge`](../post-merge/SKILL.md). `post-merge` wraps up a single
> just-merged PR; `wrap-up` closes the whole session.
