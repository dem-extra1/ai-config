# ARDI — ARD + Iterate (single PR/MR)

Drive one PR/MR to a clean review verdict by looping: read review → ARD every
finding → push → post summary → re-request review → repeat until clean.

## Procedure

1. **Identify and claim the PR/MR.** Use the current branch's open MR, or
   the one the user specified. Post a brief claim comment so a parallel
   `@claude` CI run or another person doesn't start a colliding session:
   `gh pr comment <N> --body "Driving this PR to clean — back off until done."`
   Skip if your most recent comment already says so.

2. **Read the latest review.** Pull the most recent reviewer comment (bot or
   human). Don't trust earlier cached verdicts.

3. **ARD every finding.** For each flagged item, choose exactly one:
   - **Address** — fix it, commit.
   - **Rebut** — explain why it's correct (with evidence).
   - **Defer** — file a follow-up issue, link it.

4. **Push fixes** (if any). Sync with main first if it moved ahead.

5. **Post the ARD summary** as a comment on the MR/PR (table format per the
   ARD skill).

6. **Re-request review.** If no code was pushed (all items were Rebutted or
   Deferred), the push won't auto-trigger a new review — you must still
   explicitly re-request review (e.g., post a comment triggering the bot,
   or use the forge API to request a new review). The ARD summary comment
   itself can serve as the trigger if the reviewer bot watches for it.
   Wait for the new verdict.

7. **Repeat from step 2** until the verdict has zero findings.

## Fix broken CI/workflows too

If the PR's CI checks are failing (not just the review), investigate and fix
them as part of the ARDI loop — don't declare "clean" with red CI. This
includes:

- **Workflow syntax errors** — fix them in this repo.
- **Upstream template bugs** — if the failure is in a reusable workflow from
  HACtions or a GitHub Action, file an issue (or open a PR) upstream using
  the `sup` skill, then either pin a working version or apply a local
  workaround until the upstream fix lands.
- **Flaky / infra failures** — retry once; if it persists, investigate root
  cause.

The goal is green CI + clean review, not just clean review.
## The bar

Zero flagged items under any heading. "Looks good" / "no findings" / "approved"
with no follow-on bullets. Don't stop at "ready with one minor nit."

## Asymptotic-noise guard

If after 3–4 rounds the reviewer keeps generating new nits (not converging),
surface that to the user and ask whether to continue or accept.

## On clean

Post an unclaim comment (`gh pr comment <N> --body "Done — PR is free."`) to
unblock any parallel sessions that backed off in step 1.

Always provide a clickable link to the MR/PR in the final message.

Report the final verdict and round count. Don't merge unless asked.
