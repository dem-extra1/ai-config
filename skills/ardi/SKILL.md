# ARDI — ARD + Iterate (single PR/MR)

Drive one PR/MR to a clean review verdict by looping: read review → ARD every
finding → push → post summary → re-request review → repeat until clean.

## Procedure

1. **Identify the PR/MR.** Use the current branch's open MR, or the one the
   user specified.

2. **Read the latest review.** Pull the most recent reviewer comment (bot or
   human). Don't trust earlier cached verdicts.

3. **ARD every finding.** For each flagged item, choose exactly one:
   - **Address** — fix it, commit.
   - **Rebut** — explain why it's correct (with evidence).
   - **Defer** — file a follow-up issue, link it.

4. **Push fixes.** Sync with main first if it moved ahead.

5. **Post the ARD summary** as a comment on the MR/PR (table format per the
   ARD skill).

6. **Re-request review.** Wait for the new verdict.

7. **Repeat from step 2** until the verdict has zero findings.

## The bar

Zero flagged items under any heading. "Looks good" / "no findings" / "approved"
with no follow-on bullets. Don't stop at "ready with one minor nit."

## Asymptotic-noise guard

If after 3–4 rounds the reviewer keeps generating new nits (not converging),
surface that to the user and ask whether to continue or accept.

## On clean

Report the final verdict and round count. Don't merge unless asked.
