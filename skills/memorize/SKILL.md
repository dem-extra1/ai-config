# Memorize

Persist a single fact or preference so it survives across sessions, machines,
and agents. **`remember` / `/remember` is a synonym for this skill** — same
behavior; the wording the user happens to use doesn't change anything.

Unlike `ums` (which reviews the whole session and may also update skill
definitions), this stores exactly what the user says — no scanning, no skill
updates. Memory files live in the ai-config repo, so memorize **commits and
pushes** the one change; otherwise the note is lost when the session ends
(ephemeral cloud containers are reclaimed) and never syncs elsewhere.

## When this fires

- "memorize …", "remember that …", "/remember …", "note that …",
  "add to memories: …"
- A standing directive phrased as a preference: "always …", "never …",
  "I prefer …", "from now on …"

## First: is it actually a memory?

If the request is an **automated every-time action** ("after each commit run
X", "whenever I edit Y do Z"), memory can't execute it — that needs a **hook**
in `settings.json` / `settings.local.json` (use the `update-config` skill).
Say so and route it there; don't store a note that will never fire.

## Procedure

1. **Parse** the fact/preference from the user's message.
2. **Choose scope by relevance**:
   - **Project-specific** — a fact, convention, or gotcha tied to THIS repo
     ("renders with renv via `R_LIBS_USER`") → `/memories/repo/<repo-name>.md`
   - **General standing rule** — an always-apply working preference across ALL
     repos ("always link PRs in tables", "use Pacific time") →
     `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (it's loaded every session)
   - **General reference fact** — a cross-project fact that only matters when
     relevant ("gh opens a pager — pipe to cat") → a topical file in
     `/memories/` (e.g. `tools.md`, `debugging.md`)
   - **Conversation-only** → `/memories/session/`
   - When ambiguous between project and general, judge by relevance; default
     to general.
3. **Choose file**: read the target's current contents first. Append to an
   existing section/file if one fits; otherwise create a descriptively named
   file. Don't duplicate — if it's already recorded, update in place rather
   than stacking a second copy, and say so. Delete a memory that turns out
   wrong instead of leaving a contradiction.
4. **Write** a concise bullet (one line preferred), matching the file's voice;
   include the *why* if it isn't obvious. Don't record what the repo already
   documents (code structure, git history) — capture only the non-obvious.
5. **Commit & push** the one change (skip for `/memories/session/` —
   conversation-only notes shouldn't enter the shared repo). `CLAUDE.md` and
   `memories/` are both symlinks into the ai-config repo:

   ```bash
   f="$(readlink -f ~/.claude/<path-you-wrote>)"   # real path inside the ai-config repo
   repo="$(git -C "$(dirname "$f")" rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
   git -C "$repo" add "$f" \
     && git -C "$repo" commit -m "memorize: <one-line summary>" \
     && git -C "$repo" push origin HEAD
   ```

   In an ephemeral cloud session the push is mandatory — an unpushed commit
   dies with the container.
6. **Confirm**: one sentence — what was stored, where, and that it was pushed.

## Don't

- Don't run a full session review or touch skill files (that's `ums`).
- Don't commit unrelated changes — stage only the file you wrote.
- Don't push conversation-only (`/memories/session/`) notes to the shared repo.
- Don't store secrets, tokens, or passwords.
- Don't over-elaborate — one bullet per fact.
