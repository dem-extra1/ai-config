# grade-work

Grade a folder of submissions against a solution key and distill the results
into a **ranked catalog of common error types** — the raw material for a review
session, regrade, or answer-key improvement.

**Origin:** built from grading Epi 204 Midterm 2 (survival analysis + Cox PH),
where 12 PDF submissions were compared against the course solution and the
errors became a new `rme` review chapter (d-morrison/rme PR #881).

## When to use

- A directory of student work (PDF scans, `.docx`, `.qmd`, images) plus a
  solution to grade against.
- The goal is *diagnostic* — what went wrong and how often — not just a score.

## Core principles

1. **Confirm the exam/assignment version first.** Solution files drift. The
   solution on disk may be an *older variant* than the one students actually
   sat. Before trusting it, open one blank/clean submission (or the question
   sheet) and confirm the data, tables, covariate names, and number of subparts
   match the solution. On the originating task the repo solution was a
   hemodialysis model but students sat a WCGS/CHD version with different numbers
   and an extra subpart — grading against the wrong key would have been wrong on
   every Part-2 item.

2. **Verify the key's numbers yourself.** Recompute the solution's numeric
   answers independently (a quick `python3`/`Rscript` block). Don't assume the
   printed key is arithmetically correct; you need ground-truth values to grade
   against.

3. **Anonymize in any shared output.** Describe error *patterns*, never
   individual students, in anything that leaves the grading context (review
   chapters, PRs, commits, issues). Per-student notes are fine for the
   instructor's eyes only — keep them out of committed artifacts.

## Procedure

1. **Locate inputs.**
   - List the submissions directory. Note any non-submissions (blank template,
     instructor test upload, `LATE`/partial files) and handle them separately.
   - Find the solution (search the course repo for the assignment's `.md` /
     `.qmd` / `.pdf`). Read it fully.

2. **Pin down the canonical answers.** Build a compact, per-subpart answer key:
   the correct value/derivation for each question, plus the *method* expected.
   Recompute every numeric answer to confirm it. Keep this key in your context —
   you'll hand it to the grading agents so they all grade against the same
   ground truth.

3. **Fan out the reading.** PDFs (especially handwritten/scanned) are
   context-heavy, so delegate. Spawn parallel `Agent` (general-purpose) calls,
   each handling ~3 submissions. Give every agent:
   - the full answer key and expected methods (inline in the prompt),
   - the exact file paths to read (they use `Read` on each PDF),
   - an instruction to report, **per submission and per subpart**, what was
     right and *specifically* what was wrong (concrete error types, not just
     "partially correct"), then a short per-submission theme summary.
   Send all the agent calls in one message so they run concurrently.

4. **Aggregate into ranked error types.** Collect the agent reports and group
   errors into categories. Rank by **frequency × consequence** (an error that
   silently flips a conclusion outranks a cosmetic slip). For each category
   record: a clear name, how many submissions hit it, the correct approach, and
   a representative (anonymized) description of the wrong approach.

5. **Deliver.** Produce:
   - a ranked common-errors table (category, count, the fix), and
   - optionally a per-student breakdown for the instructor (kept local /
     unshared).
   If the user wants teaching material from this, hand off to
   **plan-review-session**.

## Tips

- Round-trip the data scale: many Part-2 errors in the origin task were
  scale-confusions (HR vs log-HR, log-scale CI vs HR-scale CI). When you see a
  numeric answer, check *what scale* it's on before calling it right or wrong.
- A "right answer, wrong method" still belongs in the catalog — it predicts
  failures on the next problem.
- Note submission-logistics problems (missing pages, wrong file, unrelated
  page) separately from content errors; they need a different follow-up.
