# recover-followups — find follow-up items that closed PRs/issues promised but never tracked

The recovery counterpart to `defer-issue`. `defer-issue` files a follow-up
*when you defer*; this skill goes back through **already-closed** PRs and issues
to catch the follow-ups that were mentioned but never turned into a tracked open
issue — then offers to file them.

## When this fires

- "recover followups", "rfu", "find untracked followups"
- "audit closed PRs for dropped follow-ups", "what follow-ups slipped through?",
  "did we lose any deferred work?"
- Periodically, or after a burst of merges, to make sure nothing promised in a
  review thread or PR body fell on the floor.

Distinct from the forward/single-scope skills:

- **`defer-issue`** files a follow-up at the moment you defer (forward).
- **`post-merge`** checks deferrals for the **one** PR that just merged.
- **`wrap-up`** surfaces what's open in the **current session**.

`recover-followups` is the *retroactive, cross-PR sweep* none of those do.

## Procedure

### 1. Scope the sweep (bound it)

Querying *every* closed PR/issue in a busy repo is slow and noisy. Default to a
bounded window and **say what window you used**. Let `$ARGUMENTS` narrow it:

- a number → the last N closed PRs/issues (default `N=30`)
- a date → `--search "closed:>=2026-01-01"`
- a label / milestone → `--label tech-debt`, `--milestone v2`
- a specific `#N` → just that one PR/issue

```bash
gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq .nameWithOwner   # confirm the repo
```

The commands below are written for GitHub/`gh`; step 2 also gives the
GitLab/`glab` equivalents for the data-pull. Steps 3–5 use GitHub field names
(`stateReason`, `closedByPullRequestsReferences`) that have direct GitLab
analogues (an MR's `merged` vs `closed` state, an issue's closing MR) — adapt
them. If the matching CLI isn't installed, say so and stop — don't hit the raw
API blind.

### 2. Pull the closed items + their discussion

The follow-up promise can live in the body, a comment, or an inline review
thread — fetch all three.

```bash
# Closed PRs and issues in the window
gh pr list   --state closed --limit 30 --json number,title,url,closedAt,body
gh issue list --state closed --limit 30 --json number,title,url,closedAt,body

# Per PR: top-level comments + review summaries ...
gh pr view <N> --json number,title,url,body,comments,reviews
# ... and inline review-thread comments (NOT in `gh pr view`):
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<N>/comments --jq '.[] | {user: .user.login, body, url: .html_url}'

# Per issue: body + comments
gh issue view <N> --json number,title,url,body,comments
```

GitLab equivalents (same shape):

```bash
# In GitLab, a completed MR is `merged`, NOT `closed` (which means abandoned) —
# sweep merged ones (the main follow-up source), and optionally abandoned ones:
glab mr list    --merged --per-page 30   # completed MRs — primary source
glab mr list    --closed --per-page 30   # abandoned MRs — optional
glab issue list --closed --per-page 30
glab mr view <N> --comments          # body + discussion
glab issue view <N> --comments
# inline MR-thread notes, the glab counterpart to `gh api …/pulls/<N>/comments`
# (`:id` is glab's placeholder for the current repo's project — auto-resolved
#  when run inside the repo; no numeric ID needed):
glab api "projects/:id/merge_requests/<N>/notes" --paginate
```

### 3. Extract candidate follow-up mentions

Scan the gathered text for **intent-to-defer** language, not just any keyword.
Signal phrases:

- `follow-up`, `followup`, `follow up`
- `defer`, `deferred`, `leave for later`, `for later`, `down the line`,
  `eventually`, `out of scope`
- `separate PR`, `separate issue`, `future PR`, `another PR`, `in a follow-up`
- `TODO`, `FIXME`, `we should`, `we'll need to`, `should probably`,
  `worth doing`, `let's revisit`, `I'll open an issue`, `for the next release`
- ARD-summary sections — a `**Deferred**` or `**Acknowledged**` heading in a
  `@claude`/reviewer comment is the highest-value source: those are explicit
  "not doing this now" decisions.

A starting regex (tune per repo) — pipe the fetched bodies straight into it
(`\b` is GNU-only, so this avoids word boundaries for portability to BSD/macOS
grep; `TODO`/`FIXME` may over-match, which the false-positive cull below handles):

```bash
gh pr view <N> --json body,comments,reviews --jq '.body, (.comments[].body), (.reviews[].body)' \
  | grep -inE "follow[- ]?up|defer|out of scope|separate (pr|issue)|future pr|another pr|for later|down the line|eventually|TODO|FIXME|we should|we'll need to|should probably|worth doing|let's revisit|i'll open an issue|leave .* later|for the next release|acknowledged"
```

Keep, for each hit: the **source** (PR/issue # + the comment's `html_url`), the
**snippet**, and a one-line **suggested issue title**. Discard obvious
false positives — a `TODO` quoted from code under review, or a follow-up that
the same thread says was already done.

### 4. Cross-reference: tracked or untracked?

For each candidate decide whether it's **already tracked**:

1. **Does the snippet cite an issue?** (`#123`, `Followup: #123`, a
   `.../issues/123` URL.) If so, check that issue — and, if closed, *why* it
   closed:
   ```bash
   gh issue view 123 --json number,state,stateReason,title,closedByPullRequestsReferences
   ```
   - exists & open → **tracked** (drop it).
   - exists & closed **as completed** — `stateReason == "COMPLETED"`, or a
     merged PR in `closedByPullRequestsReferences`, or a "fixed in #X" comment →
     the work landed → tracked (drop it).
   - exists & closed **as not-planned** — `stateReason == "NOT_PLANNED"`
     (won't-fix / duplicate) with no merged PR → the work did **not** land →
     still **untracked** (keep it; a won't-fix close doesn't mean done).
   - doesn't exist → **dangling reference → untracked**.
2. **No citation?** Search open issues for a match:
   ```bash
   gh issue list --state open --search "<keywords from the snippet>" \
     --json number,title,url
   ```
   - a plausible open issue exists → likely tracked, but **flag low-confidence
     matches** for the user rather than silently dropping.
   - nothing matches → **untracked follow-up**.

### 5. Report the untracked items

A linked table — never a bare `#N` (repo policy):

| Source | Promised follow-up | Raised in | Suggested issue title |
|--------|--------------------|-----------|-----------------------|
| [#42](url) | "handle nested overrides in a follow-up" | [review thread](comment-url) | Handle nested overrides in session_env merge |

Order by confidence (explicit `**Deferred**` items first, fuzzy `we should…`
last). Add the **window you swept** ("last 30 closed PRs + issues") and a
Pacific-time timestamp (`TZ=America/Los_Angeles date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M %Z"` —
the explicit `TZ` enforces PT on a machine set to any other zone), so the user
knows the coverage and the "as of when".

If the sweep came back empty, say so plainly — don't manufacture candidates.

### 6. Offer to file (hand off to `defer-issue`)

Don't auto-file a pile of issues — that breeds duplicates and noise. Present the
list, let the user pick which to file, then for each chosen one run the
**`defer-issue`** flow: it composes the issue with a `Deferred from PR #X`
context line and a back-reference, checks for a `followup`/`deferred` label, and
prints the new issue URL. That keeps issue-creation in one place.

## Relationship to other skills

- **`defer-issue`** — the forward op (file at defer-time); step 6 hands off to
  it to file each recovered item.
- **`post-merge`** — checks deferrals for the single just-merged PR;
  `recover-followups` is the cross-PR backstop for the ones it (or no one) ever
  filed.
- **`wrap-up`** — session-level "what's still open"; this is repo-level "what did
  past sessions drop".
- **`pr-status-all`** — sibling whole-repo sweep, but over *open* PRs' review
  state rather than *closed* items' follow-ups.

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Sweeping *every* closed PR in a large repo with no bound → slow and noisy.
  Bound the window and state it.
- ❌ Auto-filing every candidate as an issue → duplicates and noise. Present
  first, file on the user's pick.
- ❌ Treating any `TODO` (e.g. one quoted from code under review) as a real
  follow-up → false positives. Match intent-to-defer language.
- ❌ Skipping the cross-reference against open issues → filing duplicates of
  follow-ups that are already tracked.
- ❌ Reporting bare `#N` instead of markdown-linked PR/issue numbers.
- ❌ Manufacturing candidates when the sweep is genuinely empty.
