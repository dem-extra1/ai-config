# ARDIAEI — ARDIA + Edit Instructions

Clear the open-PR review queue **and** capture what doing so taught you, by
composing two existing skills in sequence:

1. **Phase 1 — [`ardia`](../ardia/SKILL.md)** (ARD + Iterate-All): drive every
   open PR/MR to a clean review verdict, in series.
2. **Phase 2 — [`ums`](../ums/SKILL.md)** (Update Memories and Skills): review
   what the ARDIA loop surfaced — recurring review findings, CI quirks, tool
   gotchas, workflow gaps — and persist it by editing memory files and skill
   definitions.

The order matters: run the full review loop **first** so Phase 2 has the
complete set of lessons (every finding, rebuttal, deferral, and CI surprise) to
draw on. "Edit instructions" = update the durable guidance (memories + skills),
not the PR code.

## When this fires

- "ardiaei", "ardia then ums", "ardia + edit instructions"
- "clean all PRs and record what we learned"
- "drive everything to clean and update the instructions/memories/skills"

## Procedure

### 0. Establish context

Detect the forge (GitHub `gh` / GitLab `glab`) from `git remote get-url
origin`. Note the default branch (`main` / `master`).

### Phase 1 — ARDIA (drive every open PR/MR to clean)

Run the full [`ardia`](../ardia/SKILL.md) procedure: list every open PR/MR and
drive each to a clean verdict in series (claim → ARD every finding → push →
post summary → re-request review → repeat until clean). Per-PR rules from
`ardi` apply. If there are zero open PRs/MRs, Phase 1 is a no-op — note it and
go to Phase 2.

**While iterating, keep a running lessons list** — the raw material Phase 2
persists. Capture anything reusable:

- Review findings that recurred across PRs (a class worth a skill rule).
- CI / workflow quirks hit during the loop (e.g. canceled review runs).
- Tool gotchas, repo conventions, or commands that worked / didn't.

### Phase 2 — UMS (edit instructions)

Once every PR is clean, run the full [`ums`](../ums/SKILL.md) procedure against
the lessons list from Phase 1: for each lesson decide whether it belongs in a
**memory** file, a **skill** definition, or both, and make the edits. Don't
invent lessons to look busy — if the loop was uneventful, say so and persist
nothing.

> Phase 2 edits the durable guidance (memories/skills), which in this repo is
> committed and pushed like any other change — follow the repo's normal
> commit/PR rules for those edits (they are separate from the Phase 1 PRs).

### Final report

Print one combined summary:

```
## ARDIAEI Session Summary — <timestamp>

### Phase 1 — PRs driven to clean
| PR/MR | Rounds | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|
| [#16](url) | 4 | ✅ Clean |

### Phase 2 — instructions updated
| Target | Change |
|--------|--------|
| memory: review-double-trigger | New — recorded canceling-review CI quirk |
| skill: ardi | Added rule: don't double-trigger re-review |
```

## Stopping conditions

- Honor ARDIA's asymptotic-noise guard in Phase 1: if a single PR won't
  converge after 3–4 rounds, surface it and move on rather than spinning.
- If Phase 1 produced no durable lessons, Phase 2 records nothing — that's a
  valid outcome; don't manufacture edits.

## Relationship to other skills

- **`ardia`** / `adria` — Phase 1 in full (itself nests `ardi`, `ard`).
- **`ums`** / `update-memories-and-skills` — Phase 2 in full.
- **`record-learnings`** — the passive sibling of Phase 2; `ardiaei` is the
  explicit "do it now, after the loop" checkpoint.
- Use **`ardia`** alone to only clear the PR queue, or **`ums`** alone to only
  update instructions. `ardiaei` is the clean-then-capture combination.
