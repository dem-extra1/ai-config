# rescue-closed — comb the graveyard for work worth reviving

Closed is not the same as resolved. Issues get auto-closed by stale bots, closed
as "not planned" while the need still stands, or superseded by a PR that itself
never merged. PRs get abandoned a hair from the finish line. This skill searches
those closed items, ranks the ones still worth doing, and reopens or re-files the
keepers — without re-litigating calls that were settled on purpose.

## When this fires

- "rescue closed issues", "revive a closed PR", "reopen abandoned work"
- "what closed issues/PRs should we revisit", "comb the graveyard"
- "resurrect stale issues", "salvage abandoned PRs", "rescue-closed"
- Proactively: after clearing the open backlog (`gi` / `gii`), or during
  planning, when you want to recover threads that fell through.

Distinct from its sibling sweep:

- **`recover-followups`** mines the *content* of closed PRs/issues for promised
  sub-tasks that were never filed, then files **new** issues for them. It never
  reopens anything.
- **`rescue-closed`** (this skill) brings back the closed *item itself* — it
  **reopens** the abandoned PR or stale-closed issue as a whole unit.

Reach for `recover-followups` when a closed PR promised work it never tracked;
reach for `rescue-closed` when the closed PR or issue itself should not have
stayed closed.

## Procedure

### 1. Search — don't touch anything yet

Pull closed issues and unmerged-closed PRs along with the signals you'll triage
on.

**GitHub — closed issues** (the not-planned ones are prime candidates):

```bash
gh issue list --state closed --limit 100 \
  --json number,title,closedAt,stateReason,labels,url \
  --jq 'sort_by(.closedAt) | reverse
        | .[] | "\(.stateReason // "?")\t#\(.number)\t\(.title)\t\(.url)"'
```

`NOT_PLANNED` means closed without being done — stale, dropped, or wontfix-for-now
— so it is the most likely to be worth a second look. `COMPLETED` means finished;
usually leave those closed.

**GitHub — closed PRs that never merged** (abandoned work):

```bash
gh pr list --state closed --limit 100 \
  --json number,title,closedAt,mergedAt,headRefName,labels,url \
  --jq 'map(select(.mergedAt == null)) | sort_by(.closedAt) | reverse
        | .[] | "#\(.number)\t\(.headRefName)\t\(.title)\t\(.url)"'
```

**GitLab equivalents:**

```bash
glab issue list --closed --per-page 100 2>&1 | cat
# GitLab keeps "closed" and "merged" as separate MR states, so --closed already
# excludes merged MRs — no extra filtering needed (unlike gh, where closed
# includes merged):
glab mr list --closed --per-page 100 2>&1 | cat
```

### 2. Score what's worth reviving

For each candidate, weigh:

- **Closed by a stale bot or as not-planned**, not by a deliberate "won't do"
  → revive.
- **Still-live need** — the underlying problem still reproduces on current
  `main`. Run `check-history` to confirm it wasn't already fixed elsewhere.
- **Interest** — reactions, several commenters, or later issues/PRs that
  reference it (`gh issue view <N>` / look for "referenced this").
- **PRs near the finish** — had an approving review or only minor findings, and
  closed for inactivity rather than rejection. These are the cheapest to land.
- **Not a true duplicate** of something since merged.

Drop anything closed by an explicit human decision — "won't fix", "out of scope
by design", or "superseded" where the replacement actually merged. Reopening
those re-litigates a settled call.

### 3. Present a ranked shortlist

Report a table to the user: link, type (issue / PR), why it closed, why it's
worth reviving, recommended action. Link every `#N` as a markdown link to its
URL. Don't act yet — let the user pick from the shortlist.

### 4. Rescue the picks

Before touching any item, **claim it** (`claim-pr`) so parallel sessions or the
`@claude` bot don't collide, and **check history** (`check-history`).

**Issue:**

```bash
gh issue reopen <N> --comment "Reviving: <why it still matters>."
```

If reopening is wrong — a messy thread, or scope has shifted — file a fresh issue
that links the old one, then hand off to `st` / `gi`.

**PR — branch still exists:**

```bash
gh pr reopen <N>
git fetch origin
git switch --track origin/<headRefName>   # explicit remote; on older Git:
                                          # checkout -b <headRefName> origin/<headRefName>
git merge origin/main                     # resync onto current main; resolve, run checks
```

**PR — branch was deleted:** recreate it from the old diff, then open a fresh PR
that says "Revives #<N>":

```bash
gh pr diff <N> > /tmp/pr-<N>.patch
git fetch origin main && git checkout -b revive-<N> origin/main
git apply /tmp/pr-<N>.patch   # resolve any rejects, run the repo's checks
```

### 5. Hand off

- Reopened issue → `gi` / `st` to implement.
- Reopened or recreated PR → `ardi` to drive to clean.

## Relationship to other skills

- **`check-history`** — read-only look back at merged + closed history before
  acting. `rescue-closed` is its action counterpart: it brings the worthwhile
  closed items back rather than just reading them.
- **`recover-followups`** *(sibling skill — PR pending)* — the sweep that mines
  closed items' *content* for untracked follow-up sub-tasks and files fresh
  issues, instead of reopening the item itself. Use it when the value is a buried
  promise, not the whole closed item.
- **`gi` / `gii` / `st`** — implement a revived issue.
- **`ardi`** — drive a reopened or recreated PR to clean.
- **`claim-pr`** — claim the issue/PR before working it.
- **`clean-branches` / `prune`** — the opposite sweep: retire dead branches.
  Cross-check so you don't recreate a branch `prune` just deleted on purpose.
- **`workaround-watcher`** — for an upstream item you're blocked on, watch and
  auto-revert when it resolves, instead of manually reviving it later.
- **`defer-issue`** — the forward path (push work to a tracked issue);
  `rescue-closed` recovers the ones that still fell through.

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Reopening items closed by deliberate decision (won't-fix, or
  superseded-and-landed) — re-litigates settled calls.
- ❌ Reviving without confirming the need still exists on current `main`
  (skipping `check-history`).
- ❌ Acting before claiming — colliding with `@claude` or another session.
- ❌ Recreating a PR branch that `clean-branches` just retired on purpose.
- ❌ Bulk-reopening everything closed-as-not-planned. Triage to a shortlist and
  let the user choose.
