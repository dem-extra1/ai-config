# post-merge — wrap up a merged PR (verify, tidy, then UMS)

The per-PR bookend to a piece of work. Once a PR/MR merges: confirm it landed,
clean up the local branch, make sure nothing was left dangling, and — the
point of the skill — **run UMS to learn from how the PR went** while the
review lifecycle is still fresh in context.

## When this fires

- A PR/MR you were working on just merged.
- "post-merge", "wrap up the merged PR", "clean up after the merge", "the PR
  merged — now what?"
- Distinct from **`wrap-up`** (session-level, may span several PRs/issues) —
  `post-merge` is the single-PR version, run each time a PR lands.

## Procedure

### 1. Verify the merge — never assume

```bash
gh pr view <N> --json number,title,state,mergedAt,mergeCommit,headRefName
# GitLab
glab mr view <N>
```

Confirm `state == MERGED` and `mergedAt` is set. If it isn't actually merged,
**stop and report** — don't tidy a branch whose work hasn't landed. (The
standing **never assume; always verify** rule applied to closing out a PR.)

### 2. Tidy the local branch

```bash
git checkout main
git pull --ff-only origin main
git branch -d <merged-branch>     # -d, NOT -D
```

Use `git branch -d` (not `-D`): `-d` refuses to delete a branch with commits
that aren't merged. If it refuses, the branch has unmerged work — investigate
before forcing anything.

If other local branches were **stacked** on this one, offer to rebase them onto
the new `main` rather than deleting silently (see `cb` / `clean-branches`).

### 3. Confirm deferred items are tracked

If the PR's review loop deferred or acknowledged anything, make sure each has a
follow-up issue (preferences: *never leave deferred items untracked*). List
them, linked. File any that slipped through.

### 4. Run UMS — learn from the PR's lifecycle

Run the full `ums` procedure (invoke the `ums` skill by name), focused on what
**this PR** taught:

- **Recurring review findings** — anything the reviewer flagged across rounds
  → encode the fix so the next PR avoids it from the start.
- **Corrections / guidance the user gave mid-PR** → preference + skill update
  (per "update BOTH skills AND preferences").
- **Tool / CI quirks** hit during the loop → `tools.md` / `debugging.md`.
- **A multi-step pattern that emerged** → consider a new skill.

This is the "learn from mistakes and guidance along the way" step — a merge is
the natural checkpoint to bank those lessons before the context is gone. If
nothing durable emerged, say so explicitly rather than manufacturing edits.
(UMS commits its own changes via a branch + PR.)

### 5. Report

A linked summary: the merged PR, the auto-closed issue, any deferred follow-up
issues, what UMS updated, and a Pacific-time timestamp
(`date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M %Z"`).

## Relationship to other skills

- **`wrap-up`** — session-level bookend; also embeds UMS. `post-merge` is the
  per-PR version: run it each time a PR lands; run `wrap-up` once at session
  end. They share the verify-then-UMS shape.
- **`ums`** — step 4 invokes it.
- **`cb` / `clean-branches`** — for stacked or stale sibling branches.
- **`st` / `gi`** — the front of the lifecycle that `post-merge` closes.

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Deleting the branch before confirming the merge actually landed.
- ❌ Reaching for `git branch -D` (force) without checking why `-d` refused.
- ❌ Skipping UMS — the just-merged PR is exactly when the lessons are freshest.
- ❌ Leaving deferred/acknowledged items without follow-up issues.
- ❌ Reporting "all cleaned up" while a stacked sibling branch dangles unmentioned.
