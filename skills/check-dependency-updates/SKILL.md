# check-dependency-updates — audit dependencies for available upgrades

Find dependencies that have moved on without you. The goal is to surface
upgrades worth taking — bug fixes, new features, security patches — not to bump
everything to latest. Audit first, report what each update buys, then take the
ones that pass tests.

This is the maintenance-time counterpart to `prefer-upstream`: that skill picks
a well-maintained upstream dependency at write time; this one keeps the
dependencies you already chose current.

## When this fires

- "check dependency updates", "cdu", "audit dependency freshness"
- "are my dependencies stale?", "check for outdated dependencies"
- "should I bump the workflow SHAs?", "are there newer versions of my pinned
  actions?"
- "update the renv lockfile", "are my R packages out of date?"
- Periodically on a maintained repo — a good cadence is at the start of a
  maintenance pass, or after a long gap since the last update.

## What to audit

Run the checks that apply to the repo. The two headline cases are GitHub
Actions pins and `renv.lock`; the rest are common in this user's R/Quarto repos.

### 1. GitHub Actions pins (`.github/workflows/*.yml`)

List every action and how it's pinned:

```bash
grep -rnE '^\s*uses:' .github/workflows/ .github/actions/ 2>/dev/null
```

Pins come in two forms:

- **Tag pin** — `uses: actions/checkout@v4`. Check the latest release:
  ```bash
  gh api repos/actions/checkout/releases/latest --jq '.tag_name'
  # no releases? fall back to tags:
  gh api repos/actions/checkout/tags --jq '.[0].name'
  ```
- **SHA pin with a version comment** — `uses: actions/checkout@<sha> # v4.1.1`
  (the secure form for third-party actions). Resolve the latest tag back to its
  commit SHA so you can compare:
  ```bash
  latest=$(gh api repos/actions/checkout/releases/latest --jq '.tag_name')
  gh api "repos/actions/checkout/commits/${latest}" --jq '.sha'   # handles annotated tags
  ```
  If the SHA differs, update **both** the SHA and the trailing `# vX.Y.Z`
  comment together — a stale comment next to a fresh SHA is its own bug.

Going forward, a `.github/dependabot.yml` with the `github-actions` ecosystem
automates this sweep. Recommend it if the repo has none; this skill is the
on-demand / one-off audit and the catch-all for what Dependabot misses.

### 2. renv lockfile (`renv.lock`)

In the project, with renv active:

```r
renv::status()              # confirm library, lockfile, and DESCRIPTION agree first
renv::update(check = TRUE)  # PREVIEW available updates without installing anything
```

`check = TRUE` reports which packages are behind without touching the library
or the lockfile. To actually take updates (do this on a branch):

```r
renv::update()              # install the newer versions
renv::snapshot()            # write them into renv.lock
```

Then inspect `git diff renv.lock`, run the package's tests/checks, and keep only
the updates that pass.

### 3. pre-commit hooks (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`)

```bash
pre-commit autoupdate        # rewrites each hook's `rev:` to the latest tag
git diff .pre-commit-config.yaml
```

Inspect the diff and run the hooks once before committing.

### 4. Quarto and other tool versions pinned in CI

Workflows often pin `quarto-version:`, an R version, or a Pandoc version.
Compare each against the latest upstream release, e.g. for Quarto:

```bash
gh api repos/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/releases/latest --jq '.tag_name'
```

### 5. Git submodules

```bash
git submodule status
# for each submodule, see whether upstream has moved:
git -C <submodule> fetch && git -C <submodule> log HEAD..origin/HEAD --oneline
```

### 6. Other manifests, if present

- `DESCRIPTION` version floors (`Imports:` / `Remotes:`) — usually covered by
  the renv check; `old.packages()` lists CRAN packages with newer versions.
- `package.json` — `npm outdated`.
- `Dockerfile` base images / pinned apt or pip versions.

## Reporting and follow-through

1. **Report a table**, one row per dependency: current pin, latest available,
   and what the update buys (link the release notes / NEWS / CHANGELOG; flag
   security fixes — those are the highest-value rows). Read the changelog before
   recommending a bump, especially across a major version.
2. **File a tracking issue** for the updates worth taking (issue-first, per the
   repo's workflow — see `st` / `gi`). Group related bumps; don't open one issue
   per trivial patch.
3. **Apply on a branch**, run the repo's standard checks (render / lint / spell
   / tests), and open a PR. Keep unrelated bumps in separate PRs so a single bad
   update is easy to revert.
4. **ARDI the PR to clean** (see `ardi`).

## Cautions

- **Newer isn't automatically better.** A bump can introduce a breaking change
  or a regression. Tests are the gate; read the changelog first.
- **Respect deliberate pins.** SHA-pinning a third-party action is a security
  choice, and a major-version floor in `DESCRIPTION` may be intentional. Refresh
  the pin to a newer *vetted* version; don't remove the pinning in the name of
  freshness.
- **Update SHA and comment together** (see §1).
- **`renv.lock` is not a trivial file.** Editing it changes what every
  collaborator and CI job installs — treat a lockfile bump like any other code
  change: branch, test, review.

## Relationship to other skills

- **`prefer-upstream`** — the write-time counterpart: choose a maintained
  upstream dependency instead of hand-rolling. This skill keeps those choices
  current over time.
- **`workaround-watcher`** — watches one specific upstream blocker and
  auto-drafts the revert when it's fixed. This skill is the broad periodic sweep
  across all pins.
- **`claude-agent-workflow` / `claude-review-workflow`** — where the action pins
  this audit checks actually live.
- **`st` / `gi` / `defer-issue`** — file the tracking issue and drive the update
  PR.
- **`release-notify`** — the opposite direction: you ship a breaking change and
  notify the repos that depend on you.

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Bumping everything to latest without reading changelogs or running tests.
- ❌ Updating a SHA pin but leaving the stale `# vX.Y.Z` comment beside it.
- ❌ One giant PR mixing unrelated dependency bumps — impossible to bisect or
  revert cleanly.
- ❌ Removing a deliberate security/reproducibility pin to "stay fresh".
- ❌ Reporting "everything's current" without actually querying upstream — verify
  each pin against the real latest version, don't assume.
