# User-wide Claude Code instructions

<!--
Some sections below pull their body from a fragment in `shared/` via Claude
Code's `@path` import (e.g. `@shared/writing/plain-prose.md`). Those fragments
are the single source of truth for guidance shared with the UCD-SERG lab manual,
which transcludes the same files. Edit the fragment, not the inlined copy, and
keep fragments ASCII (write `---` for em-dashes) so the manual's character check
passes. See README.md, "Shared content".

## Run UMS before /clear

When the user says "clear", "/clear", or otherwise asks to reset the
conversation, **first** run the `ums` (Update Memories and Skills) procedure
to capture any accumulated learnings before context is lost. Then proceed
with the clear.

## Timestamp recaps in local time

When printing a status recap or summary, include a timestamp in the user's
local time zone (Pacific Time, `America/Los_Angeles` — get it from
`TZ=America/Los_Angeles date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M %Z"`; the explicit `TZ` enforces
PT on a machine set to any other zone). This makes "as of when" unambiguous when
the user reads the recap later.

## Bare queue-command keywords

I maintain a family of slash skills for managing the task queue and amending
requests: `/also`, `/first`, `/next`, `/before`, `/last`, `/and`, `/remember`,
and `/always`. When I write one of these keywords **without the leading slash**
as a directive — e.g. "also fix the test", "remember that ...", "always link
PRs in tables", "and bold it", "next, run the spellcheck", "first, revert
that" — interpret it using the corresponding skill's semantics rather than as
ordinary prose. (`/remember` and `/always` both route to the `memorize` skill.)
When the word is genuinely just part of a sentence (ambiguous), fall back to
the plain reading.

## Link PRs in tables

When listing PRs in a table (or anywhere they could be clickable), make
each PR number a markdown link to the PR URL —
`[#237](https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/pull/237)`. The plain text form
forces the user to copy/paste; the linked form lets them open the PR in
one click.

## Re-check for latest review findings before reporting PR status

**Before** reporting status on a PR (especially "clean" / "ready to merge"),
re-read the **most recent** review comment on the PR. Don't trust an earlier
"verdict" you've cached — a new review may have been posted since (by the
@claude bot, by a human, or by a re-trigger), and that newer review may
contain findings the old one missed.

Specifically: when scanning checks (`gh pr checks`) shows green or "no
failures", that's about CI state, **not** review verdict. Always pull the
latest claude comment (`gh pr view N --json comments --jq
'[.comments[] | select(.author.login == "claude")] | last | .body'`)
and parse it for any "Findings", "Issues", "Remaining" sections before
declaring a PR ready.

(A specific case of the standing **never assume; always verify** rule in
`memories/preferences.md` — confirm the verdict with a fresh query, don't
recall it.)

## Claim a GitHub PR/issue before working on it

<!-- Shared with the lab manual; edit shared/workflow/claim-pr.md, not here. -->
@shared/workflow/claim-pr.md

The `claim-pr` skill operationalizes this (the exact claim wording, when it
applies, and the closing/unclaim comment).

## File an issue before starting a new task

<!-- Shared with the lab manual; edit shared/workflow/issue-first.md, not here. -->
@shared/workflow/issue-first.md

The `st` (Start Task) skill operationalizes this; `gi` (Grab Issue) is the path
when the issue already exists.

## Tracking issues in upstream repos

<!-- Shared with the lab manual; edit shared/workflow/upstream-issues.md, not here. -->
@shared/workflow/upstream-issues.md

The `sup` / `send-upstream` skill operationalizes these steps (issue path, PR path, and the local link-back).

## Wrap up a merged PR with UMS

When a PR/MR you were working on **merges**, run the `post-merge` skill:
verify the merge actually landed, tidy the local branch (checkout `main`,
pull, `git branch -d`), confirm any deferred items have follow-up issues, then
run **UMS** to capture what the PR's review lifecycle taught — recurring review
findings, corrections, and guidance given along the way. A merge is the natural
checkpoint to bank lessons before the context is lost.

## What "fully clean" means

<!-- Shared with the lab manual; edit shared/workflow/fully-clean.md, not here. -->
@shared/workflow/fully-clean.md

Escalate a deadlock via the `request-pr-review` skill (human reviewer
`d-morrison`, or `gh pr edit <N> --add-reviewer d-morrison`), and surface the
open item to me.

## Always run ARDI on PRs you touch

<!-- Shared with the lab manual; edit shared/workflow/ardi.md, not here. -->
@shared/workflow/ardi.md

The `ardi` / `iterate` skill family runs this loop. (See *What "fully clean"
means* above; the mechanics for each step are in the sections around here.)

## Address every in-scope review comment, even non-blockers

<!-- Shared with the lab manual; edit shared/workflow/address-every-comment.md, not here. -->
@shared/workflow/address-every-comment.md

If you and the reviewer reach an impasse on a single item (your rebuttal didn't
convince them and their re-raise didn't convince you), escalate that item to a
**human reviewer** — request `d-morrison` via the `request-pr-review` skill (or
`gh pr edit <N> --add-reviewer d-morrison`) and `@`-mention them with the
impasse — for the final call rather than looping.

## Keep PR branches synced with main

<!-- Shared with the lab manual; edit shared/workflow/sync-with-main.md, not here. -->
@shared/workflow/sync-with-main.md

(Another instance of **never assume; always verify** — `git fetch` to check
main's actual position instead of assuming the branch is current. The
`sync-pr-branch` / `merge-main` skill runs this.)

## Coding style: avoid nesting; follow the lab manual

Follow the SERG lab manual (https://ucd-serg.github.io/lab-manual/) for coding
and collaboration conventions.

<!-- Shared with the lab manual; edit shared/coding/avoid-nesting.md, not here. -->
@shared/coding/avoid-nesting.md

## Writing style: plain, direct prose

<!-- Shared with the lab manual; edit shared/writing/plain-prose.md, not here. -->
@shared/writing/plain-prose.md

The `use-preferred-style` skill (alias `style`) spells out the procedure, the
PSW chapter links, and a filler/jargon swap table; the `find-ai-tells` skill
(alias `ai-tells`) is the scan-after detector counterpart.

## Writing style: scan for AI tells

The detector counterpart to the plain-prose guide above.

<!-- Shared with the lab manual; edit shared/writing/ai-tells.md, not here. -->
@shared/writing/ai-tells.md

The `find-ai-tells` skill (alias `ai-tells`) runs this same catalog on demand
against any target text.

## Useful prompt formats for coding agents

## Review with Copilot before requesting human review

This is shared lab guidance on getting an automated review before asking a human
reviewer. When *I* iterate a PR, the ARDI loop above is the mechanism — it
already addresses whatever the `@claude` or Copilot reviewer flags — so read this
as the lab-member-facing statement of the same principle, not a second loop to
run.
