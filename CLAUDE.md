# User-wide Claude Code instructions

## Run UMS before /clear

When the user says "clear", "/clear", or otherwise asks to reset the
conversation, **first** run the `ums` (Update Memories and Skills) procedure
to capture any accumulated learnings before context is lost. Then proceed
with the clear.

## Timestamp recaps in local time

When printing a status recap or summary, include a timestamp in the user's
local time zone (Pacific Time, `America/Los_Angeles` — get it from
`date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M %Z"`). This makes "as of when" unambiguous when the
user reads the recap later.

## Bare queue-command keywords

I maintain a family of slash skills for managing the task queue and amending
requests: `/also`, `/first`, `/next`, `/before`, `/last`, `/and`, and
`/remember`. When I write one of these keywords **without the leading slash** as
a directive — e.g. "also fix the test", "remember that ...", "and bold it",
"next, run the spellcheck", "first, revert that" — interpret it using the
corresponding skill's semantics rather than as ordinary prose. When the word is
genuinely just part of a sentence (ambiguous), fall back to the plain reading.

## Link PRs in tables

When listing PRs in a table (or anywhere they could be clickable), make
each PR number a markdown link to the PR URL —
`[#237](https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/pull/237)`. The plain text form
forces the user to copy/paste; the linked form lets them open the PR in
one click.

## Re-check for latest review findings before reporting PR status

**Before** reporting status on a PR (especially "clean" / "ready to merge"),
re-read the **most recent** review comment on the PR. Don't trust an earlier
"verdict" you've cached — a new review may have been posted since (by the
@claude bot, by a human, or by a re-trigger), and that newer review may
contain findings the old one missed.

Specifically: when scanning checks (`gh pr checks`) shows green or "no
failures", that's about CI state, **not** review verdict. Always pull the
latest claude comment (`gh pr view N --json comments --jq
'[.comments[] | select(.author.login == "claude")] | last | .body'`)
and parse it for any "Findings", "Issues", "Remaining" sections before
declaring a PR ready.

## Claim a GitHub PR/issue before working on it

Before starting a work session on a GitHub PR or issue — i.e. before fetching
the branch, making edits, or invoking `@claude` review cycles — post a brief
comment on the PR/issue so other humans and the `@claude` CI bot know not to
start a conflicting parallel session.

Use:

```
gh pr comment <N> --body "Claude Code CLI (local session) is working on this — paws off until I'm done."
gh issue comment <N> --body "Claude Code CLI (local session) is working on this — paws off until I'm done."
```

Then proceed with the work. After completing the session (PR merged, issue
closed, or work otherwise paused), follow up with a closing comment so the
PR/issue is unclaimed for the next person.

Skip the claim step if the most recent comment from me (Claude) on that
PR/issue already says I'm working on it.

This applies to:

- Direct fix/review/implement/debug/refactor prompts that reference a PR or
  issue (`#N`, a PR URL, or an issue URL)
- Iterative review loops (`@claude review again`, `iterate until clean`)
- Any task that will push commits to a PR branch

It does **not** apply to read-only inspection: `show me PR #X`, `what's the
status of #Y`, `explain the diff on #Z`. Those don't risk a parallel session.

## Address every in-scope review comment, even non-blockers

When iterating on a PR with `@claude review` (or any other reviewer), **address
every in-scope flagged item**, regardless of severity label. The reviewer's
"Not a blocker", "minor", "nit", "optional", "consider", or "if you want"
labels are for the user's prioritization, not a free pass for the implementor.

For each flagged item, exactly one of:

1. **Fix it in this PR.** Default path — most nits are 1–3 line changes.
2. **Defer to a tracked issue.** Only when the fix expands the PR's scope
   (new feature, broader refactor, separate concern) or the user has
   explicitly said this PR shouldn't grow. File a follow-up issue and
   reference it in a PR comment so the item isn't lost.

Then trigger another `@claude review` (or the equivalent) and repeat until the
verdict contains zero flagged items under any heading — no "non-blocking",
"harmless", "minor observation", "could improve", etc. sections. "Looks good"
/ "no findings" / "approved" with no follow-on bullets is the bar.

Do **not** report "ready to merge with one minor nit noted" / "harmless
as-is" / "can address if you want" — that hedging just pushes triage back to
the user.

If after 3–4 rounds the reviewer keeps generating new nits each cycle
(asymptotic noise), surface that to the user and ask whether to keep going or
accept the current state.

## Keep PR branches synced with main

Whenever `main` has moved ahead of a PR branch you're working on, **merge
`main` into the PR branch** before the next push or review trigger. Don't
wait for a conflict to surface or for the user to ask.

Check before pushing:

```bash
git fetch origin main
git log --oneline ..origin/main | head    # any commits? main is ahead — merge it in
git merge origin/main
```

Always do this before triggering a fresh `@claude review`, so the reviewer
evaluates the PR against current `main` rather than a stale snapshot.

Don't rebase or squash-rewrite a published PR branch unless explicitly
asked — a merge commit is the right move because it matches GitHub's "Update
branch" button and preserves the PR history.

If the merge has conflicts, resolve them, run the project's standard
pre-commit checks (render / lint / spell / tests), commit, then push. Don't
push a half-resolved merge.

## Watch PRs you open by default

After creating or opening a PR, **subscribe to its activity** (CI status +
review comments) right away with `subscribe_pr_activity` — don't ask first.
Watching is the default, not an opt-in. Keep the subscription alive until the
PR is **merged or closed**, or until I explicitly tell you to stop (then
`unsubscribe_pr_activity`). Because webhooks don't deliver CI *success*, new
pushes, or merge-conflict transitions, schedule a periodic self check-in
(e.g. `send_later`, ~1h out) to re-poll state and re-arm silently if nothing
changed.
